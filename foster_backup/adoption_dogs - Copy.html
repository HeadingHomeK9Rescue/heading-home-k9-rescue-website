  <p><strong>Welcome to Heading Home K9 Rescue!</strong></p>
  <p>Did you see a dog that caught your eye? Ready to start the  adoption process? Happy to help! Feel free to email the dog's listed contact with any questions you have...the dogs live in our homes with us so we know them very well. Please also download and fill out the preadopt application (<a href="https://form.jotform.com/201745421220138">Heading Home K9 Rescue Preadopt Application</a>)
			     and  email it in to the listed contact for the dog(s) you are interested in. We read through the application,  check references, and once approved (we aim for 24-48 hours to approve or  deny), we set up a visit with you and the foster home or direct you to an  adoption event to meet the dog(s). Fosters are more than happy to  answer questions that arise. We all want a good match the first time, and a  successful experience for the adopter and the dog. <br /><br />
    After meeting, you can choose to adopt if it seems like a good match. You will be required to complete the adoption contract and pay their adoption fee online. There is a 2 week trial on all adoptions to ensure there is time for the dog adjust and  the fit between the dog and your home is right. If the adoption does not work out in that 2 week period, your adoption fee is refunded. We encourage adopters to give it a MINIMUM of a week. Returning a dog before  that period means it never had a chance to settle in and show you what the true  personality is like. Moving dogs between homes is stressful and not in the  dog's best interests. We are here to support you after adoption also, answering  questions and helping make the process as positive as we can. We highly recommend you read the tips in this packet (<a href="Adopting101.pdf" target=_blank>Adopting 101</a>) before bringing your new dog home...it will help greatly ease the transition and make it a positive experience for everyone! </p>
<p> Our adoption fees are non-negotiable and average about $00 which includes their vet work-spay/neuter, vaccinations, heartworm testing (if old enough), and deworming. Often the vet costs far exceed the adoption fee, especially on our special needs dogs. We rely on adoption fees to be able to continue to rescue more dogs in need.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p><strong>NEXT PET ADOPTION</strong>-<strong>-</strong><strong> Our next pet adoption will be on Sunday May 20th from 1-3 at the Edina Chuck and Dons</strong></p>
  <p><strong>REMINDER: It is always a good idea to email the contact listed in each dog's bio to find out of s/he will be attending an adoption event before making the drive.  Many dogs do not attend the adoption events</strong>.<br />

  <p><strong>FOSTERS URGENTLY NEEDED!</strong>  
  <p>Due to quite a few of our fosters falling in love and 'foster failing', we are at an all time low in foster numbers.  
  <p> We cannot continue to take in dogs without foster homes. 
    
    
  <p>    We are saying no daily to hundreds of wonderful, friendly, deserving dogs because we simply have no place to put them until their forever family finds them. It's devestating to us and its costing dogs their lives.  
  <p> Please consider it and reach out with questions to <a href="mailto:kladams4545@gmail.com"target="_blank">kladams4545@gmail.com</a> 
    <p>We supply food, crate, and other necessities and work really hard to find a good match.
      <p>We can't continue to save lives without fosters. Can you help?      </div></td>

    <strong>Sex: </strong> Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Large when fully grown<br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Bonnie arrives to Minnesota on 5/7 and is looking for a home to call her own. She would love it if you would pick her up that day and make her yours. All adoptions have a 7 day trial period to ensure the best fit for dog and human(s). Please note that in order to be considered for adoption the application at the end of this bio must be completed. We choose adopters based on timing of applications as well as best fit. 

She’s fluffy and sweet, what more could you want in a puppy!! Meet Bonnie. Bonnie is coming from one of our shelter partners in Alabama so we don’t know why she ended up at the shelter or her back story but we do know she is cute. Expect all the work of having a puppy including potty training, crate training, learning what to chew and what not to chew. As a reward for all that work you will get puppy kisses and snuggles galore! We do require that adopters sign up for a training class prior to taking the puppy home as this ensures that the puppy gets the right start in life and you learn how to communicate with each other. 



<p><strong>Requirements: </strong> Training sign up required
	
<p><strong>Adoption Fee: </strong> $550 + tax. This includes neuter/spay, current vaccinations as age appropriate, heartworm/tick testing in dogs over 8 months of age, deworming, microchip and current Heartgard and Nexgard preventatives.</p>

    <strong>Age: </strong>Young Adult<br />  
 
    <strong>Sex: </strong> Male <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Large<br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Clint wants to give a shoutout to all his best friends! Did you know you're already Clint's best friend? That's right, Clint considers everyone his best friend immediately. You'd be hard pressed to find a more friendly boy than him. He was picked up as a stray and immediately hopped up in the passenger seat of the squad car ready for his ride wherever they were going. Turns out they were going to puppy jail. Clint immediately became a favorite with his always happy personality and his easy-going nature. He is excellent with other dogs and backs off nicely if he gets too friendly for them. He met a dog that did not want to play or engage with him and when she showed him her teeth he was out of there and on to the next friend. He had a similar reaction to cats. He was cautiously curious but the minute he got a hiss and a smack, Clint wanted out of there. Clint is in a shelter setting so housetraining not totally known but he keeps his run very clean so we suspect he was a house dog prior and would likely transition easily back into the house. He knows sit and is very focused and responsive to training. Food and attention-yes please! He has the energy you would expect from a young Lab so plan for daily walks, fetch, playtime, etc to keep him happy and healthy. If you love Labs, Clint is your guy! He is just about the quintessential lab. He can't wait for his best friends to take him home and become his forever family. Could it be you?

  <p><strong>Name: </strong> Frankie  <br />

    <strong>Breed: </strong>  Yellow Lab/ Golden Retriever Mix <br />
 
    <strong>Age: </strong>Young Adult<br />  
 
    <strong>Sex: </strong> Male <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Large <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Frankie is a 2 year old yellow lab/golden retriever mix who was surrendered to rescue as he had an affinity for the next door chickens. When his electric collar was on, he would stay in the yard but when the batteries ran out, he was smart and went on adventures. Rather than train him/keep the collar batteries good he was surrendered. He is a great house guest and is potty and crate trained. He gets along with other dogs and cats without issue and has lived with kids. He is what you expect a typical young lab to be, friendly, energetic and sometimes overzealous. He needs some basic manners training as he really has never had any, so we are requiring the adopters to get signed up for a training class prior to adopting/taking him home. He would love a home where he can get walks/runs and/or play ball daily to get his energy out, he is a lab of course. Because of his previous wandering behavior we are requiring a physically fenced yard vs tie out/electric fence. 

<p><strong>Requirements: </strong> Fenced yard. Training sign up required
	
<p><strong>Adoption Fee: </strong> $450 + tax. This includes neuter/spay, current vaccinations as age appropriate, heartworm/tick testing in dogs over 8 months of age, deworming, microchip and current Heartgard and Nexgard preventatives.</p>

    <strong>Description: </strong> Are you looking for a new or additional dog park companion, if so, Reggie is your guy! This boy was well socialized when he was a puppy, and it really shines through in his personality as he is a comfortable and confident guy. He unfortunately was given up due to personal circumstances, but he did live in a home prior to being in rescue so he is known potty trained and super in his kennel for the workday or when you have to run errands. He is excellent with dogs but can't go to a home wtih cats. Reggie’s bio is short because he just is a great dog who is looking for his forever!

  <p><strong>Name: </strong> Louisa <br />

    <strong>Breed: </strong>  Spaniel/ Aussie Mix <br />
 
    <strong>Age: </strong>Young Adult<br />  
 
    <strong>Sex: </strong> Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Medium/Large<br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Louisa arrives to Minnesota on 5/7 and is looking for a home to call her own. She would love it if you would pick her up that day and make her yours. All adoptions have a 7 day trial period to ensure the best fit for dog and human(s). 

This slightly timid but very sweet girl is Louisa. We think she is some sort of spaniel or Aussie mix as she has a luxurious coat that is ready to leave hair in your home! Louisa is a nice mix of being energetic but also can calm down and relax. We don’t know much about her past as she was a stray in Alabama, but she keeps her kennel clean so we think she was likely in a home before. She is slightly timid in new situations but acclimates pretty quickly. As an example when they were cat testing her, they had to sit with her for a minute or so in the cat room before she would get up and walk around. You can see her dog and cat test videos on our instagram page @headinghomek9rescuemn. Since she is slightly timid we think older kiddos would be a better fit.

Abby would like you to know that when she is around, your personal space doesn’t exist. Abby is a 1 year old cur mix who was in need of a new home when her owner passed away and had nobody to take the dogs. Thankfully Abby and her brother were taken into foster/rescue and are doing well. She is potty trained, crate trained and overall just a good dog (especially if you are looking for a 50lb lap dog). She gets along well with other dogs, and has lived with her brother all her life. She also is curious but fine with cats. She likes to see if they will play with her, but if you tell her no, she will stop. If someone was looking for a bonded pair we may be able to get her brother to come also, but they can be split also.

    <strong>Description: </strong> Look at this dapper gentleman sitting so nice for his picture! That's our Nova! He is a sweetheart who tries his hardest to do the right thing and whatever is asked of him though he's a pup so he relies on his people to show and tell him what is expected. He is smart, loves people with every inch of his wiggly body, and gets along great with other dogs and cats. Nova is working on his housetraining and is cratetrained. Expect to do all the fun puppy things-training classes, socializing, laughing at silly zoomies, lap snuggles while he is still small enough to fit, and everything else that comes with raising a good canine citizen. We require all puppies under 2 be signed up for training classes of the adopters choosing prior to going home for adoption. This sets everyone up for success!

  <p><strong>Name: </strong> Benton  <br />

    <strong>Breed: </strong> Southern Brown Dog Mix<br />
 
    <strong>Age: </strong>Puppy<br />  
 
    <strong>Sex: </strong>Male <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Medium when fully grown (best guess!) <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> A dollop of puppy dog eyes, a heaping cup of heart, a dash of smarts, and just a tiny pinch of mischief...that's the recipe that made up Benton! He is a 4 month old Southern Brown Dog Mix puppy who is just a mixed up mystery of breeds. He has a soft but slightly scruffy coat as if there might be some terrier in there, big soulful hound looking eyes, shepherd or collie type coloring....and probably 100 other things so whatever breed you like, he probably has some in there. Benton has been in his foster home for over a month now and is doing fabulous. He is a lap snuggler extraordinaire, loves to snooze and get love, but then in true puppy fashion likes to race around at lightning speed with a toy trying to get the other dogs to play chase. He is the typical sleep hard, play hard puppy. Benton is excellent with other dogs, cats, and kids. He has a great start to training but with all puppies expect to finish up housetraining, expect some accident clean up from oopsies, expect socializing and training time put in to teach them to be a well-behaved canine citizen. The foundation and training you put in to a puppy pays off a million times over when you have the end product of a well-behaved adult dog.  We do require that puppy adopters sign up for a training class prior to taking the puppy home to ensure a good socialization and foundation for the puppy to grow up.

    <strong>Size: </strong> Small/ Medium <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Bernard arrives from out of state on 4/2 and is looking for an adopter who wants to pick him up that day when he arrives. All adoptions have a 7 day trial period to ensure the best fit for dog and humans. 

Bernard was found by a Good Samaritan completely matted and left to fend for himself. Our rescue partners had a foster home open for him and so were able to take him into safety. He wasn’t so happy about people at first, but once he figured out they were there to help and the vet clinic got all his matts out, he feels like a new dog. Bernard’s favorite activities include sleeping and eating canned food. He is dog friendly, but probably would not appreciate a young playful dog in his face al the time. At 10+ years old, he is looking to live his golden years being spoiled. He is potty trained, crate trained and ready to be your next companion.

    <strong>Sex: </strong> Male <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Large <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong>Gabe has spent a decent amount of time in the shelter being overlooked. He doesn’t “show” well in a shelter setting as he is absolutely terrified and so he gets passed by time and time again. Well Gabe has one his ride up north to a foster home. There is not one mean bone in this dog’s body, just a dog who has no idea about the world and takes it slowly. When he first arrived in the shelter he would pancake to the ground when the put a leash on him- he likely has never seen one before. Once in the play yard, he so wants to be brave. He will take pets from the volunteers but what he really loves is other dogs. He absolutely lights up with another dog around and takes cues from them on the outside world. A home environment will likely be new for him, so he needs someone willing to be patient with him and go at his pace. He has met the kitty friends at the shelter and was curious to see what they were but scarred for life when one batted at his face. Safe to say we think he can live in a home with kitties. With time and another dog in the home we know Gabe will gain the confidence he needs to be a real dog in the world! Gabe is also heartworm positive, he will be treated once he arrives to Minnesota.

    <strong>Sex: </strong>Male <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Large/ Extra large when fully grown <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> If you are looking for a big lap dog, look no further than Henry! This guy is all about the snuggles and love. Henry found himself in puppy jail at a local impound after being picked up as a stray and no one came to claim him. He is friendly, outgoing, loves all people, gets along great with dogs, and is curious but respectful of the cat when he met them through the cage at the impound. Typical puppy, he is finalizing his housetraining still but has the idea very much down with a schedule. He crates for the workday well. Henry is a smart boy and picks up training quickly! He is going to be a big boy as an adult, we are guessing 80+ lbs since he is 50 lbs currently so please be prepared for a large breed dog before committing to adopt. We require all dogs under 2 years old to be signed up for training classes prior to adoption. This sets everyone up for success.

  <p><strong>Name: </strong> Woofie  <br />

    <strong>Breed: </strong>  Border Collie Mix <br />
 
    <strong>Age: </strong>Puppy<br />  
 
    <strong>Sex: </strong> Male <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Medium/Large when fully grown <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Woofie arrives from his out of state foster home on 4/2. He is looking for an adopter who wants to take him home when he arrives! All adoptions have a 7 day trial period to ensure best fit for both human and dog. 

  <p>Woofie is a sweet, silly approximately 6 month old puppy from Alabama who has a great start due to his foster. His foster is really in love with him but it just isn’t the right time to add another dog as she has to have knee surgery and can’t give him the time he needs. He lives with 3 other dogs and does great with all of them. He was curious, as most puppies are, about the kitties and wanted to see if they would play with him. They didn’t and he got the point of leaving them alone after one swatted at him a few times. This gentle soul also got beat up by the duck that lives on the property, and he just wanted to make some new friends. He has been around kids and loves them. He would love a home where he can sleep in bed, get lots of belly rubs and have another doggo friend to play with. Another dog isn’t required but we think he would really thrive in that environment best. Being likely a collie mix this guy has some energy, so don’t think you are adopting a couch potato even though he is fairly mellow. He is 95% potty trained (sleeps in his fosters bed at night and has no accidents). He needs a bit of work on the crate training, he isn’t such a fan, so that will be something his adopters will need to work on. He also loves to go for car rides and is great in the car. We do require that all puppies get signed up for training class before taking them home.

    <strong>Description: </strong> If you are looking for the cutest puppy award winner, look no further than Minnie! She is best guessed to be a corgi mixed with something smoother coated with her little short legs and cheerful demeanor. She is social, playful, silly, and all around just a loveable little pup.  She is used to kids, cats, and other dogs and loves everyone.  Being a pup, housetraining and cratetraining are a work in progress.  Expect to do all the fun puppy things-training classes, socializing, laughing at silly zoomies, lap snuggles while he is still small enough to fit, and everything else that comes with raising a good canine citizen. We require all puppies under 2 be signed up for training classes of the adopters choosing prior to going home for adoption. This sets everyone up for success!

    <strong>Sex: </strong> Male <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Medium when fully grown <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Bryan arrives to rescue from out of state on 4/2. He (or his brother) are looking for an adopter to pick them up and take them home the day they arrive. All adoptions have a 7 day trial period to ensure best fit for dog and humans. 

How cute are these brothers? They are short legged, one curly tailed, very happy boys who were found on the side of the road in a garbage bag. Yes you read that correctly, someone threw them out as trash. Thankfully our rescue partners found them and were able to take them in, and they were not left outside for long. Now that they are safe, they are happy, healthy puppies. We truly have no idea what breed mix they are, our best guess is corgi (short legs), puggle (curly tail) and lab. We expect these guys to stay small to medium sized when full grown. Expect all the fun of puppy kisses, silliness and snuggles as well as all the work of potty, crate and leash training. Puppies are a lot of work but so worth it. We do require that adopters sign up for puppy training classes before taking them home on 4/2.

    <strong>Sex: </strong> Male <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Large <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Tater arrives to Minnesota from out of state on 4/2. He is looking for an adopter (or foster) interested in picking him up the day he arrives. All adoptions have a two week trail period in order to ensure best fit for both dog and humans. 

Tater is a hunky land hippo looking for his forever home after finding himself abandoned at a rural AL shelter. He caught our eye being calm in the midst of chaos at the shelter and sitting politely waiting his turn. He is a bit on the chunky side (probably the COVID 5 like most of us), so once he arrives losing a little weight will be good for him and his joints. He did great meeting other dogs- he wags his tail and is friendly but not super playful-as mentioned he is just kind of a big old chill dude that would probably enjoy your couch and snacks as much as you do. He is good in his kennel and we think he is potty trained as he tries to keep his kennel clean, but likely will need a home refresher. He did test positive for heartworms as his previous people apparently didn’t keep him on prevention. He will begin treatment once he arrives in Minnesota. You can read more about heartworm disease and treatment here: https://www.headinghomek9rescue.com/Heartworm.pdf

Reese is energetic, loving, social, and full of snuggles and kisses. She has been well socialized with everyone and it shows in her even, friendly temperament. She is used to kids, cats, and dogs and loves everyone. Remember though, puppies are a lot of work! Expect potty training, accidents, socialization, and teaching them how to be good canine citizens.

    <strong>Description: </strong> Brownee is a sweet, somewhat unassuming dog that was left behind when her owners moved. It is truly their loss as this dog is wonderful. She is a young adult – estimated to be about 2 years old and about 50lbs. She loves everyone and everything she meets, though she can be a bit shy at first while she takes in the situation. She can play and be the mother to the puppies at the rescue or the adult dogs, she is good with all though her play style is more rough and tumble. She is friendly to the kitties but does try to play with them some, so a dog savvy cat would be best for her. She has energy (and needs a daily outlet) and loves to play, but also will settle and cuddle with her dog or human friends. Her foster has taken her to doggie day care a few times and she does well. Older children would be best for her as she can be somewhat exuberant when she has energy. Overall she is a wonderful young dog who would do well with continued training and a home that isn't going to leave her behind! We do require that dogs 2 and under be signed up for training class prior to taking her home.

    <strong>Description: </strong> Who says you can't have a pretty face, a great personality, and smarts to boot? Alma is all of the above! She is excellent with all people and greets everyone she meets with a wagging tail politely waiting for them to notice and give her some attention. She lives with other dogs and does great with them as well, but no cats for her!  Alma is housetrained, cratetrained, and minds her manners wonderfully in the house other than being a bit opportunistic if something tasty is left on the counter and no one is watching. She picks up things in a flash and is so easy to train. Walks are a favorite of hers and her wiggles of joy when she sees that leash come out is adorable. After her walk she loves nothing more than a good snooze by your feet or with her head in your lap while you relax too. Alma is about 70 lbs and 4 years old. She is an easy-going, easy to love girl who is the whole package when it comes to good dogs.

    <strong>Sex: </strong> Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Large <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Widow is an incredibly behaved, sweet girl. She is mellow, docile and seems to get along with everyone and everything. She came to the local shelter as a stray with what we think either is a sister from another mister or daughter. You can tell she has been loved before, but nobody came to pick her up. She was only in the shelter a few days before heading to foster. She is great with the other dogs in her foster home and loves the kiddos. We have not directly seen her with kitties but based on her personality we think she’d be fine living with feline friends. She is potty trained and crate trained though probably doesn’t need a crate as she is good left out.

    <strong>Sex: </strong>Male <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Medium  <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Sir Reginald McNubbins sure is a fancy name for this guy who found himself in doggy jail and not reclaimed. Mr. McNubbins here was named because of his happy little nubby bulldog tail and his short little stocky legs. He looks like such a big dog from the front because of his broad shoulders and big head but really, he’s a little nubby guy all around. Reginald is friendly with all people. Instantly people are his best friends and of course they are there to pet him? Who wouldn’t be! This is actually true though. You can’t help but want to love on this goofy looking little guy. He is fine with dogs and ignores cats as well.  He is housetrained and cratetrained but doesn’t need the crate either. Reginald is looking for a forever home who loves the bulldog types! He is best guessed based on his size/shape to be French Bulldog mixed with English Bulldog and he has all the silliness, snortiness, and personality of those breeds. We are head over heels for this fancy named boy. He is a million pounds of personality packed into a 35 lb body!

  <p><strong>Name: </strong> Marvelous Miss Maple  <br />

    <strong>Breed: </strong> Yellow Lab  <br />
 
    <strong>Age: </strong>Puppy<br />  
 
    <strong>Sex: </strong> Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Large when fully grown <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Marvelous Miss Maple (or just Maple for short) arrives to Minnesota from out of state on 3/5. She is looking for an energetic adopter who wants a partner in crime to pick her up on that day and take her home. All adoptions have a two-week trial period to ensure the best fit for dog and humans. 

Maple was surrendered to our rescue partners down south when the owner no longer had time for the puppy they got. She has a good start to life and knows the basics of being a house dog. She is what you would expect from an 8-month-old lab puppy- full of energy! Once that energy is out she is happy to sleep in bed with you so she can be close! She will be a great walking (or running) partner as she already as leash skills. She is also potty and crate trained. She is good with other dogs, but we have not seen her around kitties so we can’t say on the feline friends. She will be spayed once she arrives in Minnesota as out vets down south are booked up before she hitches her ride north. She would do best in a home with a fenced yard though that is not a requirement if the adopter is committed to enough daily exercise. We do require that you sign her up for training classes prior to bringing her home. Even though she has a good start, all dogs benefit from basic obedience!

    <strong>Sex: </strong>Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Small <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> June is a sweet 1-2 year old,  25lb mix girl who found herself in need of a home. She came in with her suspected sister as a stray. She is currently in foster care in Alabama and thriving with her foster parents, they just love her. They tell us she is a fantastic dog- super cuddly and sweet. She is dog friendly but absolutely needs to be fed separately from other dogs as she doesn’t want to share her food. Other than not sharing her food, she has been great with the other dogs she has met. We have not seen her with kitties at this time but suspect she would be ok with some supervision at first. She is doing great with potty training and kennels for the workday while her foster parents are not home.

    <strong>Size: </strong> Large<br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> If you had to sum up Hadley’s personality into just a few words, happy go lucky is what we would use for this girl. Yes she found herself in a shelter but she still makes the most of everyday while she is there. No matter if it is cuddling up to one of the workers for some love or playing with her dog friends you can almost see the smile on her face. She is estimated to be 2-3 years old and is 70lbs, so she is full grown. She would love a home with another playful pup to romp about with, but this is not a requirement as long as she gets daily exercise either in walks or playing ball etc. She does well in her kennel and is doing well with potty training (though expect some accidents when she transitions).

    <strong>Description: </strong> Lucie arrives from out of state on 3/5! We are accepting applications for an adopter (or foster) who wants to pick her up when she arrives from Alabama. Adoptions have a two-week trial period to ensure the best fit.

Sweet demure Lucie was brought to the shelter with one of her puppies as the owners didn’t want them anymore. She has had a few litters in her past, but she is done being a momma now! Her care takers say she is “such a good girl” at the shelter where she is at. She is pretty laid back, taking everything in stride and adjusting to her new environment. She has been out in the play yards with many different dogs and does well with each one. Her cat test was adorable as she walked up to the kitties and gave them kisses, so we think she’d be fine in a home with feline friends. She could use a little work on walking on a leash, she is a bit all over the place, but likely she has never been taken on a formal walk before. She tries to keep her kennel clean so we think the adjustment to a home and potty training will be a breeze, but expect a few accidents (like any pup) as she adjusts. She’s a doll and would love for her forever home to pick her up on 3/5!

    <strong>Age: </strong>Adult<br />  
 
    <strong>Sex: </strong>Male <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Large (85-90 lbs)<br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Tom arrives from out of state on February 5th. He is looking for an adopter (or foster) who wants to take her home when he arrives so he can hitch his ride north.  All adoptions have a two-week trial period to ensure the best fit for dog and humans! 

Tom Petty is a heartbreaker! Don’t let the grey face fool you on this gentle giant he still has some spunk and playfulness left to him. Tom is a middle age to older adult who has been loved on and well socialized and it shows. He loves people (even the kiddos- though he might knock the little ones over), and he enjoys giving “hugs”. (He might need to work on giving unsolicited hugs.) He is very comfortable in a house, so much so that this is how he found himself needing a new home. He was out wandering, found some people that looked nice and followed them into their house. He promptly put himself on the couch between the two kids and called it an evening. He wasn’t microchipped and nobody came for him during his stray hold. He is dog friendly and still likes to romp around (see his video on petfinder or our instargram account) and didn’t pay attention to the kitty in his finders home. He appears to be potty trained, and likely doesn’t need a kennel during the day if his people are out- he is happy to take a nap on the couch. Tom needs an adopter or foster to hitch his ride north, is that you?


Tom tested positive for the pesky heartworms, he has started his pre-treatment and will finish treatment once he arrives here in Minnesota. Learn more about heartworm  disease and treatment here: <a href="Heartworm.pdf" target="_blank">Heartworm Treatment</a>

    <strong>Description:</strong> Ash is a fun and active puppy who loves to play and is ready to be in her forever home and
learn all the things it takes to be the best pup! Expect all the fun of puppies including being on
1000% or sleeping, puppy kisses, watching them explore their new world but also all the work
of potty training, teaching what they can chew on and obedience! We promise Ash is worth all
the work as she is going to be a fabulous companion. She has a great start in life (with her

    <strong>Description: </strong> Scar is a tough name for a stocky, wiggly marshmallow of a dog. This guy is anything but tough! He wears his heart on his sleeve, loves everyone he meets, and is excellent with other dogs. He is respectful of the cats (ok, a little afraid of them!) and when one hissed at him he wanted nothing to do with it. He is playful, loves to fetch, loves his toys, and has the best time figuring out puzzle toys and kongs. Scar is an all around great bully boy. He is housetrained, crates well though does sing the songs of his people if he can see you, and is an excellent snuggler. He is about 9 months old. We require all dogs under 2 be signed up for training classes of the adopters choosing prior to going home for adoption. This sets everyone up for success!

    <strong>Description: </strong> Rooney arrives to Minnesota from out of state on 3/5 and is looking for his forever home to pick them up the day they arrive! All adoptions have a two-week trial period to ensure they best fit for puppy and humans alike. 

These little nuggets are just the cutest things and little balls of fluff. Mom was a Weimeraner, dad we think was a lab mix that hangs around the neighborhood. These pups found themselves in rescue as the owner is in hospice care and his aid was trying to help find the dogs homes before he passed. These puppies are energetic and loving, full of puppy kisses and snuggles. But don’t get caught up in all the fun, puppies are a lot of work! Expect to be getting up in the middle of the night to potty train them, cleaning up accidents and teaching them the ways of the world! They will be about 9-10 weeks when they arrive to Minnesota. We do require that puppy adopters sign up for a training class prior to taking the puppy home to ensure a good socialization and foundation for the puppy to grow up!

    <strong>Description: </strong> Maple is here in Minnesota and settling into her foster home nicely. She is loving playing with her foster siblings (who are about 40lbs) and can for sure hold her own. Her fosters tell us she is a great puppy so far. She likes to be held and give kisses, and she wouldn't mind taking a nap in your lap. They have a smaller area just for her with her toys and crate and she enjoys playing with her toys and keeping herself occupied. She gets up once in the middle of the night, goes right outside to go potty and then comes back into bed. She is really a gem of a pup. Expect to continue working on potty and crate training, but know she has a solid start!

    <strong>Description: </strong> If you are looking for a fun small dog that is full of personality, Tails is your dude. Tails is ready for his forever home where he can run, play and also snuggle with his people. Tails has an interesting background. He was brought to the vet in Mississippi for euthanasia when his people no longer wanted him. See Tails, aptly named, doesn’t have use of his tail or control of his bowels and he was born this way. He has a tail, but it just always hangs straight down. His owners decided they no longer wanted him, but he is such a lovely dog otherwise the vet asked for to be signed over to a rescue. He is truly a wonderful dog and we know there is an owner out there that is ok with him needing to wear a diaper in the house. Pee wise, he has full control of his bladder and is potty trained, but poop wise he wears a diaper and has usually one solid poop a day. Outside of this he is dog friendly and lives with a bunch, he is cat friendly but 100% thinks they should play with him so he may be a bit much for some kitties and might harass them.


<p><strong>Requirements: </strong> Home that understands his needs and is ok with diaper or poop accident

    <strong>Description: </strong> Rio is looking for a new home, not because she is a bad pup but life circumstances changed for her original owners and they can no longer give her the time and attention she needs to be happy. Rio is 5 year old Boston Terrier who has an energy and zest for life. She is no couch potato, this girl would love to go for runs and walks with you, in her past home she ran 3 miles a day with her person. She also loves to play fetch, and will play as long as you thrown the ball or toy. Once exercised she loves to snuggle with her humans. She has never been around cats so we don’t know how she would do (we suspect she might chase them). She is good with dogs but will guard food and toys, so she will need to be fed separate if there are other dogs in the house. She does not guard from humans, just other canine friends. She is potty trained and will let you know when she has to go out, and does well in her kennel for the work day. We are looking for a home with active adults and no super little kiddos to be her forever!

    <strong>Description: </strong> Kit is leaving her past behind her in Alabama and arrives on February 5th. She is looking for a loving home who wants to take her home when she arrives. All adoptions have a two-week trial period to ensure the best fit for dog and humans!

Kit is a sweet, polite, unassuming girl who’s past you’d never know by meeting her. Based on how good of a pup she is, you’d think she had been in a home before etc, but unfortunately Kit was the product of a cruelty case. Her first years of life were spent in a tiny outdoor pen with no shelter. Well, that is the past and now she gets her chance. Kit is in a foster home and doing fantastic. She is pretty mellow, gets along with the resident dogs- though she does want to be a bit bossy with other females at first, doesn’t mind the kitties and is just sweet. She is doing great on her potty training and kennels well when left, though she may not need it. Kit had the pesky heartworms from not being cared for properly, but treatment has already been completed, her adopter would just need to retest her 9 months later. Who is looking to help Kit move forward with life and show her what Minnesota nice is all about?

    <strong>Description: </strong> Carolyn arrives on 2/5 from out of state and is looking for an adopter who wants to take their new puppy home that day. All adoptions have a two-week trial to ensure best fit for puppy and human!
 
Those puppy dog eyes are about the cutest you have ever seen. Carolyn is a a fun loving, silly, sweet, either on 1000% or sleeping  pup who is ready to absorb all the learning you teach her. Though it isn’t all fun and games with a new pup so expect all the work of getting up in the middle of the night, cleaning up accidents and training also, but we promise it is worth it. She has a great start from her foster in Alabama (where she is coming from) where she has started learning potty and crate training but expect this to be a work in progress in a new home. She is great with dogs, cats and kiddos (though puppy teeth are sharp).  We do require that all puppies are enrolled in a puppy obedience class prior to taking your new friend home!

<p><strong>Requirements: </strong> Training class sign up required
	
<p><strong>Adoption Fee: </strong> $500 + tax. This includes neuter/spay, current vaccinations as age appropriate, heartworm/tick testing in dogs over 8 months of age, deworming, microchip and current Heartgard and Nexgard preventatives.</p>

    <strong>Description: </strong> June is a sweet 1-2 year old,  25lb mix girl who found herself in need of a home. She came in with her suspected sister as a stray. She is currently in foster care in Alabama and thriving with her foster parents, they just love her. They tell us she is a fantastic dog- super cuddly and sweet. She is dog friendly but absolutely needs to be fed separately from other dogs as she doesn’t want to share her food. Other than not sharing her food, she has been great with the other dogs she has met. We have not seen her with kitties at this time but suspect she would be ok with some supervision at first. She is doing great with potty training and kennels for the workday while her foster parents are not home.

    <strong>Description: </strong> Bond arrives from out of state on 2/5 and is looking for an adopter (or foster) to pick him up when he arrives. All adoptions have a two-week trial period. 

The names Bond, James Bond but this Bond isn’t looking for a martini (shaken not stirred), he is looking for his forever home. Bond is a young adult pup with the cutest wonky ears we have seen in a long time. Can you believe he was once almost hairless due to neglect? Well not anymore:) We just couldn’t get over how cute he was and we knew we could find him his forever home here in MN. Bond is dog friendly, is curious about kitties but backed off when they hissed at him and sweet with people. He is working on potty training and crate training and doing well. He does have an eye condition called entropion, where the eyelids curl in and the lashes rub on the eye (OUCH!) The rescue group in Alabama (where he is coming from) is getting the inflammation under control so he is more comfortable. Once he arrives in Minnesota we will get him to our vet for the surgery to permanently correct that (covered by the rescue). Are you looking to give this cutie a home? Apply today:)

    <strong>Description: </strong>  

Aldo is a goofy, wiggly, sweet approximately 50lb shepherd mix. This boy is all sorts of fun and ready to go to an active adopter. Aldo’s favorite things are chasing the ball, playing with other dogs and water. He was found as a stray in rural Alabama and never claimed during his stray hold. Our guess is he was expected to stay in an unfenced yard without training or collar and he wandered away. He needs an adopter that is committed to daily exercise in order to be happiest. He would love a home with another dog to roughhouse with, and would be best paired with another energetic dog as he may annoy an older dog that doesn’t want to play. While he doesn’t want to harm the kitties he will chase them so a home without cats will be required. Aldo is a great pup who would love to get out of the shelter and into his own home! Are you that home?

    <strong>Description: </strong> Freehope is a special girl looking for a special home. Found on Freehope street in rural Alabama, this girl was likely dumped. A good Samaritan saw her one day, and tried to catch her but she was terrified. Knowing that living on the run is not a great place for a dog, this woman set out a trap to catch this girl. Once she was trapped she turned into a totally different dog. She is incredibly sweet and seeks out human attention at every chance she can. She was with the woman who found her for several weeks before a kennel at the shelter became open for her so she has been in a home before. She is great with dogs, cats and super gentle sweet with kids. One thing you need to know about Freehope is she is deaf. Likely due to bad breeding, she was born with no hearing but it doesn’t stop her from living her life to the fullest. She will need patience and time with training that is a bit different from other dogs. Due to her being deaf we are requiring that adopters sign up for a formal training class before taking her home to ensure everything gets started on the right foot.

  <p><strong>Name: </strong> Dorothy  <br />

    <strong>Breed: </strong> Yellow Lab Mix<br />
 
    <strong>Age: </strong>Young Adult<br />  
 
    <strong>Sex: </strong>Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Medium/Large  <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Dorothy arrives from out of state on February 5th. She is looking for a lab loving adopter who wants to take her home when she arrives. All adoptions have a two-week trial period to ensure the best fit for dog and humans! 

While she isn’t headed to Kansas, Dorothy is getting her ride north, so she finds her “no place like home” feeling. Dorothy and her siblings were dumped at a small-town Alabama shelter, all 4 beautiful, we think purebred labs. Dorothy is the sweet, gentle, slightly timid one of the group. She loves getting pets and told she is a beautiful girl and just soaks up all the attention she can get. She also loves to meet her canine companions, so this girl could go to a home with a current dog or as the only dog- she would be happy either way. She was tested with the shelter kitties and did some sniffing but ultimately was not very interested. She is working on potty training and is smart and does well in a crate for while you are out or at work. She is a gem! Dorothy tested positive for the pesky heartworms, she has started her pre-treatment and will finish treatment once she arrives here in Minnesota.

    <strong>Sex: </strong>Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Large <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Hi there, I'm Bonnie! I was a little shy and nervous when I first arrived to the shelter as a stray, but now that I am in foster I feel much better now, and I really enjoy the company of people, dogs, and cats! I love to be outside where I patrol for the evil squirrels. I also really love my bed or to be snuggled on the couch with my foster parents. I also REALLY like food and treats so you could probably teach me all kinds of tricks with the yummy snacks as my reward! I am probably the cutest potato around. I am house trained and crate trained and just a really good pup!

    <strong>Sex: </strong>Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Large when fully grown<br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Snuggly and sweet Willow is ready for her forever home! Willow is an exceptional pup and incredibly smart. She has picked up on what is expected of her so quickly making her a really easy puppy to have. Don’t let that fool you, she is still a puppy and will need continued guidance and training but she has a great start. She is dog friendly and loves to play and romp around and is good with kids. We haven’t seen her around cats at this time. She can make it overnight in her kennel without accidents and only has had a few accidents during the day- she knows she needs to go outside but sometimes if her humans don’t let her out quick enough she will. Her left eye is what is called “cherry eye” which is a prolapsed 3rd eyelid gland that can be common in these breeds. It will be fixed at the time of her spay surgery but does not cause her any discomfort at this time. Adopters will be required to enroll in puppy training class prior to taking her home.

    <strong>Description: </strong> Maybelline is a teeny little pocket pittie who is full of wiggles and snuggles. She is the sweetest thing. All she wants is to crawl up into someone and smother them with kissies and love. Maybelline is doing well on the housetraining, crates well, and has good manners in the house. She is excellent with other dogs, loves all people including kids, and is suspected to be fine with cats though has not lived with them. She is medium energy and loves her walks and zooming around the yard but is perfectly happy once she is exercised to crawl under the covers and melt into her people for cuddle time.

    <strong>Sex: </strong>Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Medium/Large<br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Cider (and her sister Autumn who came in December and is adopted) found themselves in need of a new home when their breeder no longer wanted them. They were purposely bred Aussie x labs that never sold so hung out on the breeders property until they found out that chickens were fun to chase. You can’t blame the girls - they never were paid any attention and well chickens are fun to chase. The breeder no longer wanted them after the chicken incident and dumped them at the shelter. Cider is about a year old and sweet as can be. She is incredibly dog friendly, pays no mind to the shelter kitties and just soaks in the love. While she hasn’t been an indoor dog before, she is used to going potty outside so potty training should be a breeze (her sister picked it up in a day). She wants to please, so training will also be easy with this girl. She is gentle and so while she hasn’t been in a home with kids we thnk she would be fine with them.

  <p><strong>Name: </strong>Boomer<br />

    <strong>Sex: </strong>Male <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Large <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Boomer is all about finding the fun in anything and everything. This boy is a hoot! He is 70 lbs of dopey, happy-go-lucky wiggle butt. He can find joy in anything. A bone to chew on? This is the best bone ever! A dog to meet? The newest best friend and playmate! The snowy winter? The best season ever and snow is delicious! Everything is the best ever to him. He wears his heart on his sleeve and holds nothing back. He leads with exuberance and that loving heart of his which sometimes leaves his brain scrambling to keep up, but he is a smart boy, food motivated, and extremely responsive to training. He would excel in training classes and anything his owners wanted to teach him. Boomer is excellent with other dogs and ok with dog-savvy cats though will try to play with them and has zero awareness that he is a big dog. He loves kids to pieces but again, he's a big boy so sometimes he is the bowling ball and the little kids are the pins so he is best with older kids who are a little more sturdy. He doesn't have a mean bone in his body. It appears Boomer had some mistreatment or lack of socialization with men so certain men frighten him a bit on initial meeting. He warms up with some treats and time but his initial reaction when meeting some men is to give some big, loud barks and avoid. He has never shown any aggression, just avoids and barks. His fear demographic seems to be younger adult to middle aged white men. He went on a man meeting tour and had no issues with the older men, younger teens, or black men he met, though he definitely preferred to seek the attention of women. He would benefit greatly from someone who will help build his confidence and socialize him properly. He can absolutely be adopted to a home with men in it but expect the first week or so for them to need to do some extra confidence building and be the primary caretaker to build trust with him. Once he hands his heart over though, he is yours for life. There's no shortage of love or loyalty in this guy! Boomer is housetrained, cratetrained though needs a sturdy crate or he'll use his big head to push his way out, and learning the ropes of being a well-trained boy.  Like any young dog he loves and needs his daily exercise. He walks well on the leash on a prong collar and he loves to play with toys. He is an excellent snuggler and is pretty sure he is a lap dog. Boomer is going to make someone so darn happy they chose him. He is going to make you laugh every day with his pure unbridled joy for life. As with all dogs under 2, we require him to be signed up for training classes of the adopter’s choosing prior to adoption

    <strong>Age: </strong>Senior<br />  
 
    <strong>Sex: </strong>Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Small/Medium<br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Charley will be arriving from out of state on January 8th. We are accepting applications for an adopter who would like to pick her up that day and have two weeks with her in their home to make sure it is a good fit.

Charley is a senior cocker left at the shelter in terrible shape and badly overdue for a grooming. She has been cleaned up now with a good shave down and some TLC. Charley is social, good with everyone, used to kids, cats, and dogs though gravitates towards the quieter rather than the chaos of the younger ones. She likes naps in the sunshine, meanders around the neighborhood, and soaking up all the love. She is housetrained and crates well but doesn't need it. She does need to have a lipoma (benign growth) removed and a dental done when she arrives--this is covered by HHK9 at one of our vets. She is very overweight at about 40 lbs and needs a home who will help her lose some weight to get her back into healthy shape with both diet and exercise. As a cocker spaniel, she will require grooming both in brushing at home and regular trips to the groomers for haircuts. Charley is an absolute doll and is searching for a retirement home to adore her as she deserves to be.

    <strong>Description: </strong> Have you ever wanted the personality of a Labrador but in a smaller size? Well here is your chance! Clover arrives on 1/8 and is looking for a foster or adopter to pick her up that day! All adoptions have a two-week trial period. 

Clover here is a happy go lucky girl just looking for her forever home. She was found as a stray and not claimed which landed her in the shelter. Thankfully a foster picked her up, so she is now in a foster home and doing really well! She loves to romp and play with the other dogs in the house, play fetch but then settles nicely for cuddles on the couch either with her human or doggo friends. She is also respectful of the kitties in the house! She is ready to give her forever family all the exuberance and love they can handle and will bring a smile to your face everyday with her goofy personality. She is potty trained (though expect a few accidents as she transitions and does well in her kennel). She arrives on 1/8 from out of state and needs a foster or adopter to step up and commit to her in order to make the journey.

    <strong>Age: </strong>Adult<br />  
 
    <strong>Sex: </strong>Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Small/Medium<br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Can you believe that this sweet girl was almost euthanized? Found as a stray and brought to a rural Alabama shelter her time was limited due to the number of dogs they must care for. Our rescue partners in Alabama swooped in to save her! This approximately 30lb girl is sweet and estimated to be about 3-4 years old. She is both dog and cat friendly and has done well in the shelter where she is. She is good in her kennel, so kennel training here will be a breeze. Her potty training status is unknown but she does try to keep her run clean, so likely she will pick up your routine fairly quickly! She arrives from out of state on 1/8 and would love her forever home to pick her up. All adoptions have a two week trial period!

    <strong>Description: </strong> Who is looking for their cuddle buddy for the holidays! Loretta arrived from Alabama about a week ago and is here to say she is a great girl. She is getting used the the cold and snow, BURR, but good news is she loves to cuddle. Loretta came from a foster home in Alabama where she lived with 2 other dogs and 2 kiddos. She loves the kiddos!! We think she might chase a cat, so she would be best without a meow friend, but did do well with the chickens at her previous foster (they were in a coop). She is potty trained, quiet (would be a good apartment pup), and crate trained though she probably doesn’t need a crate. While she was in Alabama she was treated for heartworm disease and we are happy to say she is now negative! She also had a mass removed from her leg. They got the whole thing, so the only follow up is to keep an eye on the area. This girl promises to be your new best friend!!

    <strong>Age: </strong>Young Adult<br />  
 
    <strong>Sex: </strong>Male <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong>Large  (65 lbs)<br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Stan is everything Lab lovers love about the breed! He is friendly, happy-go-lucky, never met a stranger, and is pure unbridled joy for life. Dumped with his 3 sisters at a rural shelter in the middle of the night we don’t know much about his history, but whatever it is he is more than ready to look to the future and his forever home. Do you have another dog? Stan would love to be their bestie! He thinks every dog is his bestie in fact and watching him play bow and flop down in hopes someone will join in his fun is just about the cutest thing ever. Do you have kids? Stan would love to be their besties too. If they can throw a ball or play with him, even better! Have cats? Stan doesn’t mind. He was timid of the shelter kitties that hissed and smacked at him. He might try to play with a more social cat but takes a correction from the cats well to back off. Stan is a well-rounded, social guy. He is finishing up his housetraining and learning that marking in the house is not acceptable but crates well. He knows how to sit and is working on his other obedience and training. Stan is positive for heartworm. He has been started on the pre-medications and will go through treatment (included in the adoption fee) once he arrives. You can learn more about heartworm disease and treatment here: <a href="Heartworm.pdf" target=_blank>Heartworm Treatment</a><br />You can also see photos and videos of him on our instagram page @headinghomek9rescuemn.

  <p><strong>Name: </strong>Abigail<br />
  
    <strong>Breed: </strong> Black Lab Mix <br />
 
    <strong>Age: </strong>Adult<br />  
 
    <strong>Sex: </strong>Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Small/ Medium<br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Abigail will be arriving from out of state on January 8th. We are accepting applications for an adopter who would like to pick her up that day and have two weeks with her in their home to make sure it is a good fit. 

Sweet Abigail was found neglected and down on her luck. She arrived at the shelter a literal mess- her skin was in horrible condition from poor nutrition, infection, fleas and non-contagious mites, she had heartworm disease and she was underweight. Unknown if she had just been on her own for a while or if she was a true owner neglect case we are not sure. She is in a foster home in Alabama (where she will be coming from) and soaking up the TLC. Her skin is light years better- still needs some hair to grow in but that just takes time and she has been started on the medications to begin her heartworm treatment. Her foster says she is just easy. Quiet, polite, good with the other dogs and cat in the home. Loves to lay in comfortable spots and soak up the love. She is potty trained on a schedule, she crates well but probably doesn’t need one. She is about 30lbs right now with an ideal weight around 35lbs. Her estimated age is about 6-8 years old. Abigail will either have had her heartworm injections prior to travel or will get them when she arrives. She’s an absolute gem.

    <strong>Description: </strong> Callahan arrives on 1/8 from out of state and is looking for an adopter who wants to take him home that day. All adoptions have a two-week trial period to ensure the best fit for both human and pup! 

Meet our New Years litter, well they were not born on New Years, but that is when they came to our rescue partners. Mom, a full blooded beagle, was left when previous tenants moved and did not take her with. She was left to wander, un-spayed, and low and behold had some puppies! They are all bright, spunky and fun loving puppies who are ready to make somebody or family very happy. They will come up to date as age appropriate on vaccinations and deworming, but will need more vaccinations through your veterinarian as they get older. They are not spayed/neutered yet but this does come included in the adoption fee, so when they are old enough we will have them done at our vet partners. Expect all things puppy- potty and crate training, waking up in the night to let them out, chewing on things they shouldn’t, but also all the puppy kisses and snuggles you can imagine. We do require adopters to enroll in a basic training course prior to taking the adopted pup home!

Is this adorable face not absolutely to die for? We sure think so. This is Gwen and she is as sweet as she is cute. Gwen is a snuggly, perpetually happy, outgoing, and all around awesome 9 week old beagle mix pup. She is fostered with kids, cats, and dogs and loves everyone. She meets new people happily and sees everyone as an instant friend. She is just a pup so homes should be ready and committed to all the work and the fun of a puppy--housetraining, socializing, basic manners, and lots of puppy love and play. She has an incredible start already. She is expected to be beagle sized as an adult. As with all young dogs, we require her to be enrolled in a training class of the adopter's choosing prior to adoption.

  <p>Are you looking for a sweet, mild mannered, even tempered girl who wants to cuddle with you through the cold winter? Darla may just be your perfect fit. This lovely just under 50lb girl is known in a home as she was adopted from one of our southern rescue partners. The adopter loves her to pieces but having two dogs in the home has really ramped up the owners allergies and so she can no longer keep miss Darla. Darla is potty trained, crate trained (though she probably doesn’t need it), good with dogs, cats and kids. She is incredibly sweet and just melts into you for pets and snuggles. She is truly a one of a kind pup who is going to make someone very happy!

She is very good with other dogs but cannot be placed with cats. She is housetrained and crates well for the workday. She is currently in an impound setting and needs a foster/adopter in order to leave and move into a home. For lovers of northern breeds, she is a dream!

    <strong>Description: </strong> Brutus is a tough name for this little squish of a puppy! He found himself wandering the streets on his own so ended up in puppy jail and no one came for him. Their loss is someone else's gain because this guy is sweet as can be. He is excellent with dogs, loves all people, and good with cats (though we always caution that puppies sometimes will try to play). Brutus is a smart cookie and learning his housetraining, cratetraining, and all his manners but his new home will need to plan to do all the typical puppy training and things to continue to raise him to be a good canine citizen. He loves toys, loves walks, and blends puppy silliness and fun with also being a snuggly little cuddle monster. We require all dogs under 2 years old to be enrolled in a training class of the adopter's choosing prior to adoption

  <p><strong>Name: </strong>Autumn<br />

    <strong>Age: </strong>Young Adult<br />  
 
    <strong>Sex: </strong>Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong>Medium <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Autumn is a young adult Aussie x lab mix who was dumped, with her sister, after the owner/“breeder" could not sell them and one killed a chicken. Autumn is an incredibly sweet, slightly timid girl who wears her heart on her sleeve. At first she was terrified to walk on leash, as this was never something she had to do, but she has gotten so much better in her time with our rescue partners. She was likely kept as an outdoor dog, so she is going to need to learn the routine of being an inside girl. We think she will pick it up fast as she really wants to please. She will likely have a few accidents when she transitions, but many of the previously outdoor dogs pick up on potty training pretty quickly. Because she is still a bit timid on leash, a home with a fenced yard would be best for her. She is great with other dogs, we are waiting on the rescue to test with kitties. She is a really lovely dog, ready to finally be loved. (We also have some puppy photos of her). Check out our instagram for more photos and videos of her in the coming days @headinghomek9rescuemn!

<p><strong>Requirements: </strong> Home with yard space. 

	
<p><strong>Adoption Fee: </strong> $450 + tax. This includes neuter/spay, current vaccinations as age appropriate, heartworm/tick testing if appropriate, deworming, microchip, and current preventatives</p>

    <strong>Description: </strong> Cinnamon found herself at a local impound after being found in a window well. How this girl got there we’ll never know. She is a laid-back, gentle, go-with-the-flow girl who isn’t fazed by much. She is a favorite at the impound because she is just so easy. While the other dogs bark and act wild (understandable!), she waits patiently and quietly in her run just wagging her tail. Cinnamon is excellent with dogs, fine with cats, and great with people. She is housetrained, crates well, and minds her manners in the house. She loves her daily walks and has excellent leash manners, but overall isn’t a high energy dog. If you’re looking for an easy girl with a heart of gold, Cinnamon is it.

    <strong>Description: </strong> Who is looking for a chocolate Friday present for themselves. Yes, we renamed Black Friday to chocolate Friday for our hunk Joey. Joey was found frolicking with no collar, no microchip on the streets of MN without adult supervision which landed him in doggy jail. Joey was hoping his people would come bail him out but nobody showed up, so now Joey is ready for his new family. This wiggle butt is all about fun. Chasing balls- fun, going for walks- fun, playing with the humans- fun, food- fun. Well you get the point, everything is fun! As a young Labrador, Joey still needs some guidance on manners/less exuberance and training, but he really wants to please so we think this will be easy with some consistency and exercise. He would do best in a home with daily exercise (playing ball, walks etc) and preferably a back yard to romp in though this is not required. He is great with other dogs and loves to play, so a doggy play friend would be fun for him, but also is not required. He tested fine with the shelter cats, even seemed somewhat afraid. Joey is a lovely boy and is ready to go home with you for chocolate Friday!

    <strong>Description: </strong> Beautiful black Bentley is in need of a foster or an adopter so we can bring him to rescue! He was found wandering the northern ‘burbs of MN with no collar and no chip. Animal control completed his stray hold, posted him etc but his people never came. Bentley is a great pup- he is estimated about 2-3 years old, gets along with all dogs and loves life. We don’t have the ability to cat test him where he is at right now. He is great with all people, kennels well and wants to please. This guy should be a breeze to train. Once in rescue he needs to get neutered but is then ready for his forever home. His ideal home would be one where he gets daily walks or ball throwing, as well as lots of belly rubs and treats!

    <strong>Age: </strong>Adult<br />  
 
    <strong>Sex: </strong>Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong>Medium <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Loretta is due to arrive from out of state on 12/4 and is looking for an adopter to commit to taking her home that day. All adoptions have a two week trial period to ensure best fit for both dog and humans. 
Loretta is an approximately 5 year old pitty who is about as sweet as they come. This girl was found as a stray in not the best shape- she was very skinny, she had heart worms and she was not spayed, yet she let none of that get her down. Our shelter partners got her in a foster home and took care of her medical needs so now she needs a forever home. Her foster home describes her as practically perfect. She is great with the other dog in the home, LOVES the little kids she lives with and doesn’t mind kitties or chickens. She is fine in a crate, through she is potty trained (expect some accidents as she transitions) and they say they haven’t heard her bark much. Translation- a well behaved dog. She was originally going to come in November but the vet found a few lumps and bumps on her we wanted to investigate more. The ones on her belly were not concerning and no further care is required since they are now gone. She had a lump on her knee that ended up being a mild form of a tumor. We got the whole thing out and follow up will just be monitoring that area. There is a small chance it could come back in that area. We are so excited to have her come in December now that she is all fixed up. You can see more photos of her on instagram with the kiddos and other dogs!

    <strong>Description: </strong> You might laugh at her name, sure, but Squishy Wiggles is full of puppy squish and stub tail wiggles where her whole body wiggles hence her name! We promised her a forever home that will love her forever as well as give her a much better name. She is a 5 month old Rottie puppy who is as beautiful as she is friendly. She loves people, excellent with other dogs, ok with cats, and thinks everyone is a best friend. She was found abandoned and no owner came forward to reclaim her. She is working on her houstraining and crates well for the workday. Like all puppies, she does need continued training, socialization, and a commitment to raising her to be a well-mannered pooch. She has a heck of a start already and is going to excel in anything she is taught. We require all dogs under 2 be signed up for training classes of the adopter’s choosing prior to adoption.

    <strong>Description: </strong> Izzy arrives to Minnesota from out of state on 12/4 when she will be available for adoption. 

Izzy is a sweet girl who ended up at a rural Alabama shelter after she was found roaming without adult supervision. She was in good shape, well fed and obviously cared for, so they were hopeful someone would show up to claim her, but they never came. Shelter life isn’t easy, it is loud and chaotic but Izzy has adapted well and is still sweet despite all the changes. Even the dog in the same kennel as her gets all worked up and she stays calm and collected. She is still in a shelter situation but we assume she will adapt quickly back to home life. She is dog and cat friendly and does well with all humans. She is going to make a lovely addition for someone looking for a small terrier mix. She is adoptable once she arrives on 12/4 and we are accepting applications to meet her after she arrives.

Salem is one of those once in a while amazing dogs that come through that we just can't understand how they ended up not getting reclaimed. Someone is going to be so lucky to call her theirs.

    <strong>Description: </strong> Maybelline is a teeny little pocket pittie who is full of wiggles and snuggles. She is the sweetest thing. All she wants is to crawl up into someone and smother them with kissies and love. Maybelline is doing well on the housetraining, crates well, and has good manners in the house. She is excellent with other dogs, loves all people including kids, and is suspected to be fine with cats though has not lived with them. She is medium energy and loves her walks and zooming around the yard but is perfectly happy once she is exercised to crawl under the covers and melt into her people for cuddle time.

She is great with dogs and unknown with cats so until we know for sure is no cats in the home. She is in a shelter situation so housetraining unknown, but she keeps her kennel run clean so we suspect she at least has the basics down. She is an amazing girl who has so much love to share.

  <p><strong>Name: </strong>Piper <br />
  
    <strong>Breed: </strong> Mini Lab Mix  <br />
 
    <strong>Age: </strong>Young Adult<br />  
 
    <strong>Gender: </strong>Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Medium<br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong>Piper is now truly ready for her own home. She arrived to us  back in September as a shy, scared pup who clearly hadn&rsquo;t had much  socialization early on in life. Whatever her early life was, she was found as a  stray in Alabama and ended up in the shelter. Being terrified, the shelter was  not a great environment for her. She would sit in the corner of her run hoping  not to be noticed, so getting out of the shelter was going to be a struggle for  her. 9 months later, one of our shy fosters had an opening for her and she got  to come to Minnesota. She has made SO much progress in the short time of being  here we feel she is ready for her own forever. Before you keep reading about  how wonderful she is, please know she will likely never be the super outgoing,  go anywhere, do anything kind of dog.&nbsp;She will need patience and time to  adjust to another new environment, and when you meet her she probably won&rsquo;t  come up and say hi as she is still not fully trusting of all humans (though she  might take a treat from you). But on to all the great things about her and why  you should consider her! When Piper first arrived most of her time was spent in  her kennel (by choice with the door open). She LOVES her kennel and will hang  out in it just to hang out. Despite loving her kennel, she doesn&rsquo;t really need  one as she is fully potty trained and good in the house. She will sleep in her  kennel overnight or while you are gone without a peep and goes in without any  issue. As I mentioned she is fully potty trained and only had one accident the  first day. She is allowed to sleep at night outside of her kennel wherever in  the house and is an angel. She loves other dogs. She is fostered with 3 other  female dogs and does well with them though she wishes they would play with her  more. She enjoys shenanigans with them out in the yard, chasing squirrels,  birds or just trying to get them to play. Her forever home should have another  dog as it will help her adjust immensely and may tire out your current pup from  playing also:) She also loves walks- she came not knowing what a leash was or  how to walk, but she picked it up quickly and is the first to the door to go  for walks. She can go for walks by herself or with her friends, she doesn&rsquo;t  care, and walks have helped her gain so much confidence in herself and trust in  her humans. Her foster has also ran with her a short distance and she seems  open to that, though would need endurance training. She is learning that human  pets feel good and lets her foster mom pet her, but she isn&rsquo;t one to come over  and ask for pets yet. If you have patience, a fenced yard and another playful  pup please consider giving Piper a a chance at being your forever. Once she  bonds with you, you are going to have a best friend and a very loyal pup for  life. You can see photos and videos of her on her instagram page:&nbsp;<a href="http://instagram.com/fostersheadinghomek9rescue" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://instagram.com/fostersheadinghomek9rescue&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633522517107000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENiEAhiXkrECmoiCnSjYfjh2swlw" fg_scanned="1">instagram.com/fostersheadinghomek9rescue</a>!&nbsp;  
  <p>Favorite things: chasing squirrels with her friends,  shenanigans, food, walks</p>

    <strong>Sex: </strong>Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong>Medium <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Carter arrives from out of state on 12/4 and is looking for an adopter to commit to picking her up that day. All adoptions have a two-week trial period to ensure best fit for dog and humans. Carter is a sweet young lab mix (full grown at about 40lbs) that was left in a kennel, like trash, when her people up and moved and didn’t take her. Animal control was immediately called by neighbors and Carter was taken to safety. It was clear her people were not coming back, so she is ready for her new home. This girl is sweet sweet sweet. She the perfect size for going anywhere, she loves dogs and rolled over when the cat hissed at her. As most young dogs, she will need some basic obedience  training when she gets here. She has a good foundation on potty training, but expect some accidents as she transitions out of shelter life. Her ideal home would be one where she can get her sillies out, perhaps with another canine companion, and then snuggle up to her people. She LOVES people. She is a lovely dog that would like to be yours when she arrives on 12/4. Check out our instagram page @headinghomek9mn for more photos and some videos of her.

Your girl Rosie here checking in to tell you how cool I am. I am in a foster home in Alabama where I was found as a stray. I am glad I found my way to a foster because I really enjoy being in a home with all the comforts and the nice people. I am a pretty chill girl, I love a good nap, some sunshine, a little romp in the yard and maybe another nap. Oh yes, I also like a good belly rub, those are my favorite. I live in a home with another pup and do great. I haven’t been tested around kitties, but they are going to see how I do in the next few weeks. I do well with kenneling and potty training, though expect a few accidents in the new home because it is a new environment and new routine. Whatever my previous life was I acquired the nasty heartworms because I wasn’t on prevention. The nice people in Minnesota are going to treat me for this once I get to Minnesota. You can read about what the heartworm treatment is like here: <a href="Heartworm.pdf" target=_blank>Heartworm Treatment</a>. The treatment does require me to have to do more naps and less activity for 6 weeks which I think I am going to be ok with.

    <strong>Description: </strong> Sawyer - With ears like these, who needs a hang glider! Sawyer is a little honey who takes a bit of time to warm up but not for lack of wanting love. She’s a lovely little lap dog once she feels safe. Best guess is she’s a mini-beagle/dachsund mix at just over 15 lbs. She has demonstrated near perfect house training in foster with access to a fenced yard. She thrives with another canine companion to take her cues from and loves to run out and explore with the big dogs. She likes walks and can keep up with the briskest of paces but hasn’t figured out how to do her business on a leash so fenced yard and another dog are preferred. She crates perfectly at night and for workday if necessary. She goes in unprompted and doesn’t make a peep as it’s clearly a safe space for her. In fact we’ve never heard her bark! Her picture actually makes her look bigger than she is. She’s small but she’s good with all sized dogs. (She can walk right under her foster’s dogs and likes to curl up with them on the couch). She’ll be a very easy addition to any family with the patience to help her over her initial shyness. She clearly craves love and is a very good girl already  She is positive for heartworm and being treated.

    <strong>Sex: </strong>Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Medium/Large (about 50 lbs) <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Good gollie miss Mollie, this sweet girl is a gem! How she has been adoptable for so long is beyond us, but from our rescue partners that have her, she is an amazing dog. At approximately 1.5 years old this girl is the fun loving, dog friendly pup that everyone wants in the perfect 50lb size range. She is also cat friendly, she was just curious about the shelter kitties and wanted to sniff them. Her lab personality has won all the shelter staff over as she is just a doll when they interact with her. She is good in her kennel and mostly potty trained, though expect her to have some accidents as she has been in a shelter environment for a while and likely needs a refresh on being in a home. Mollie would love a home with a nice bed she can curl up on, belly rubs & ear scratches are life and walks to explore her new world.

    <strong>Description: </strong> 
 Bonnie is excited for her journey up to Minnesota as it means she gets a better shot at finding her forever home. Bonnie was a stray picked up and held at a rural Alabama shelter. In her time at the shelter she has made friends with literally every human that has interacted with her. She LOVES her belly rubs, butt scratches and really just any human attention. When the volunteers get there Saturday to update photos of new dogs, she enjoys getting out in the play yard for attention and treats. Bonnie is an incredibly sweet girl. She gets along well with other dogs and did well with her shelter cat test. We think she would do well in just about any home where she got some exercise and snuggles. In fact, we think she is going to make an excellent warming blanket for the upcoming winter months.

Ted is described by his out of state foster home as pretty much perfect. This approximately 5 year old, 45lb (needs to gain som weight) boy has been a joy to have she told us. He is mostly a calm boy but does like to play when he is feeling the urge. He is a great cuddle partner and loves to be next to you taking a snooze while you watch your favorite show. He is potty trained, thought expect an accident or two as you both adjust to a new routine. He walks well on leash and would love to go for some nice fall walks to sniff the sniffs and enjoy the sunshine. He also is great with both dogs and cats alike. I mean, who wouldn’t want this boy!!

    <strong>Description: </strong> Sophie arrives to Minnesota on 11/6 and is looking for an adopter that wants to take her home the day she arrives. All adoptions have a two week trial period to ensure the best fit for dog and humans!

Fun loving, active, sweet Sophie is getting her ride to Minnesota!! This beautiful girl is looking for a home where she can go for walks, play in the yard, maybe chase a tennis ball or play with a friend and then come in for snuggles and love. She is an incredible dog who is truly just happy. She has been used in the shelter for testing other dogs as she seems pretty even keeled and she even got to run around and play with Bonnie (another adoptable coming)- you can see more photos/videos on instagram). She did pretty well on her shelter cat test, but she did bark at the cat that hissed at her, so a no cat home or a dog savvy cat would be best for her. She does well kenneled for the work day and is working on perfecting her potty training. This girl is going to be a fun match for someone looking at a nice balance of energy and chill.

    <strong>Description: </strong> Jethro is fluffy pooch who is ready for someone to fall in love with his handsome face and take him home. He is a young pup still so his adopters should plan for all the puppy things—housetraining, cratetraining, socialization, and basic manners. Due to puppy teeth being razor sharp and being too young to know what is/isn't okay to chew/mouth, we are prioritizing adoptive homes without very young children to ensure positive experiences for all! One sharp toothed playful mouthing can be a very scary thing for young kids. We require all dogs under 2 years old to be enrolled in a training course of the adopters choosing prior to adoption.

    <strong>Description: </strong> Junior is a roly, poly bundle of love!  Junior was surrendered to rescue after his caretaker died of COVID in Kentucky.  Junior is a very sweet boy. He loves every person he meets including neighborhood children.  He’s good with other dogs and would benefit from having another dog to be his companion or have someone who is home more often than not.  He had canine companions at his previous residence.  He will kennel, but is not terribly fond of it; he would rather be with his humans. He’s a bit needy  (mild separation issues) but is doing better.  Someone will really appreciate that about him as he is a constant companion.   Junior loves to cuddle and give kisses.  He will benefit from a home where he will get regular walks and dedication to help him shed a few pounds - he loves walks!  He is housebroken on a schedule and is working on basic commands.   Overall, he’s probably the most loving, sweetest, well-behaved his foster has ever had!

    <strong>Description: </strong> Loretta arrives from out of state on 11/6 and is looking for an adopter to commit to her and pick her up the same day. All adoptions have a two week trial to ensure best fit for humans and canine!

Loretta is an adult (approximately 5 years old) sweet pitty mix who really embodies everything good about the breed! Previously an outdoor dog found in Alabama, she is now loving the indoor life in her foster home. She lives with another dog, 2 kiddos and a bunch of chickens and does great with all of them. She is potty and crate trained and does well letting you know if she has to go out. Her foster says that is really the only time she barks, to alert you! She loves to take sun naps, get belly rubs and supervise her kiddos playing. The shelter down south has gotten her veterinary care all up to date and treated her for pesky heartworms as in her previous life she was not on preventatives. Have we mentioned how important those are? Loretta is looking for a home to head to as soon as she arrives to Minnesota on 11/6. Don’t overlook this great pup, she is a gem! Check out some more photos of her on our instagram page- we are going to post some pics of her with the kiddos and chickens the week of Oct 23!

The happiest, dopiest puppy on the block: meet Fendi! Fendi was out running around in Alabama (where he is coming from) and animal control was called to come get him. The officer opened his door and friendly Fendi jumped right in, ready to go for a ride. Unfortunately nobody came looking for him after his stray hold so he will make the journey to MN!! He is a giant cuddly goofball. His legs go in many different directions, he thinks he is hysterical doing the zoomies but he isn’t all that fast and loves other pups. He doesn’t seem to mind the cats at the shelter, but he may try to play want an indoor cat if left to his own devices. All things are friends to him. He is estimated 8-10 months old, 35lbs right now, neutered and up to date on his vaccinations. We do require that all dogs under 2 years of age (and some other specific situations) be enrolled in a training class prior to taking him home.

    <strong>Description: </strong>  
 Francisco is an approximately 1.5 year old lab who was surrendered along with 10 other labs when the owner no longer wanted them. Our rescue partners got to work and an amazing foster was able to put up an outdoor shelter so they could accommodate all of the dogs. Francisco is unbelievably sweet. He loves people. He gets along well with all the other dogs and the kitties that live at the property also. He would be a great addition to just about any home. He has mostly been an outdoor dog, so will take a bit of adjustment to being in a home, but he is smart so we think he will figure it out quickly. The good news is that ones that have been primarily outside before often are easy to adjust and potty train as they are used to going potty outside. He is good in his kennel for the work day. 
  <p><strong>Requirements: </strong> Home with yard space. 

<p><strong>Adoption Fee: </strong> $450 + tax. This includes neuter/spay, current vaccinations as age appropriate, heartworm/tick testing if appropriate, deworming, microchip, and current preventatives</p>

  <p><strong>Name: </strong>Lucy Lou<br />
  
    <strong>Breed: </strong> Alabama Special  <br />

    <strong>Description: </strong> Lucy Lou is a young adult Alabama Special who is a social, ready made family girl. What’s an Alabama Special you might ask? Also known as a Southern Brown Dog it’s a breed we made up for a mixed up mystery coming from our shelter partners in Alabama. We can’t tell what makes up Lucy (or many of the dogs we take in) so they’re Alabama Specials! There’s possibly some Lab, some Shepherd, some Hound, some Terrier, some of pretty much every common breed since those are common strays in rural areas. Lucy is a total sweetheart. She loves everyone she meets instantly, loves other dogs, and does well with kitties. She has both dogs and cats in her foster home! She is a bit shy when you first meet her, she will belly crawl over to you for pets and kisses but warms up quickly. She loves to play with her foster siblings and gains confidence from them. She has not had any accidents in her foster home and crates well for overnight or when people are away from the house. She really is a sweet girl who wants to please, so training should be a breeze. She is heartworm positive and will be fully treated 9/26. We do require Lucy to be enrolled in an approved basic training course prior to taking her home, and all adoptions have a two week trial to ensure the best fit for dogs and humans.

    <strong>Description: </strong> We cannot get over how much we love this guy! He is a goofball, always happy, and loves everyone. His ears can't decide what they want to do-up, down, one up and one down. He makes us laugh with his personality and silly face. He loves other dogs and makes a wonderful playmate for another active companion. He is fine with cats and previously lived with a house pig so livestock is not a problem either. Humphrey is young, about 9 months old, and 40 lbs fully grown. He is smart, responsive, and food motivated making him a breeze to train. As with all dogs under 2, we require that he be signed up for a basic training class prior to adoption.

    <strong>Gender: </strong>Male <br />

    <strong>Description:</strong> 

Billy Lee has had a great start to life. He was adopted from a local shelter in Alabama as a puppy and lived in a home with his people. Unfortunately, his adopters decided to return him to the shelter when they were planning on having a baby as they felt it would be too much. So, at 10 months old, Billy Lee is now looking for his forever in Minnesota. He is well socialized, sweet and mild mannered. He was house and crate trained, though now that he has been back in the shelter he may need a refresher once he gets to his forever home. He is dog and cat friendly and would do well in just about any home.

    <strong>Description:</strong> Malin was found in rural Alabama running down the middle of a road when a nice human picked her up so she wasn’t hit. She was marketed for her people to come get her but nobody ever did. Our rescue partners took her in, got her healthy (treated her heartworms) and she was adopted by one of the shelter volunteers until she became the product of divorce. This girl is looking for her for real forever this time and she isn’t going to let you down. She is dog/cat/kid friendly so any home really would work for her. She still has some spunk left, so she wants to play or go for a walk to get her energy out and then is content to relax and chew on toys. Her one love is a tennis ball, she will carry them around, chew on them, play with them, she just can’t get enough. She is great in a kennel, 99% potty trained (will have an accident if left for long periods of time >8 hours but won’t if she is in a kennel) and just a fun girl. Don’t let her age fool you, this girl has a lot of love left to give!

    <strong>Size: </strong> Medium/ Large (when fully grown) <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Bill is a happy-go-lucky little pup who was part of an unwanted litter brought to a rural shelter with his siblings. He loves other dogs, fine with cats, and thinks all people are the best. He is a snuggly, playful, loving pup who is content to be held and loved on balanced with silly puppy tossing toys all over and playing rowdy with his siblings. He is a very young pup still so his adopters should plan for all the puppy things—housetraining, cratetraining, socialization, and basic manners. Due to puppy teeth being razor sharp and being too young to know what is/isn't okay to chew/mouth, we are prioritizing adoptive homes without very young children to ensure positive experiences for all! One sharp toothed playful mouthing can be a very scary thing for young kids. We require all dogs under 2 years old to be enrolled in a training course of the adopters choosing prior to adoption.

This petite pitty girl is ready to be your new best friend and cuddle buddy. Her foster says she is a lovely girl who gets along well with other dogs. (She did well with other dogs in the shelter and she lives with another dog in foster.) She did well with the kitties in the shelter, but she has not had home experience with them. She is perfecting her potty training (a few accidents to be expected) but loves her kennel and does well in there. She even goes into her kennel to take a nap once she is tired. She needs a bit of work on not pulling on leash, but that will come as she has probably never been leash walked before! She is ready to be your number 1 friend. She is here in MN and can be met/adopted. All dogs under two years old (this includes Marge) are required to be enrolled in a basic training class prior to adoption.

    <strong>Description: </strong> Chappa is a handsome Shepherd/ Lab mix who was purchased as a puppy during covid and then found himself at the shelter at 10 months old when life circumstances changed. He is going to make someone an incredible companion! Chappa is timid with new things, people, and experiences initially due to lack of socialization but he warms up with some patience and becomes your newest best friend. He is going to need someone to commit to training him, building his confidence, and teaching him how to be the best canine citizen he can. He is currently in a shelter setting so housetraining is unknown but he was reported to be housetrained. He is good with other dogs and it is not known how he is with cats. Because of his initial timid behavior he needs a home with older children/adults. All dogs under 2 years of age are required to be enrolled into a basic obedience training class prior to adoption.

    <strong>Breed: </strong> Retriever/ Great Dane Mix <br />
 
    <strong>Age: </strong>Adult<br />  
 
    <strong>Gender: </strong>Male <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Large<br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> 
Charles is accepting applications for an adopter who is wanting to take him home when he arrives from out of state on 10/9. All adoptions have a two-week trial period. 

Charles is coming to us from Louisiana by way of Alabama. An AMAZING dog who unfortunately had his owner pass away a few months back leaving him homeless. He has been with the same over since he was a puppy (he is about 8 now) so he is well socialized and well loved and it shows. He is a calm, gentle giant who amidst chaos is still very chill. He was in a foster home in Louisiana with 18 other dogs, 15 cats and a house pig, so it is safe to say he is good other animals. He is both potty and crate trained but he doesn’t need a crate as he is good in the house. He would be content to lay with you while you work, take a low key walk and just enjoy life. He is a special boy	
<p><strong>Requirements: </strong> Home with yard space. 

<p><strong>Adoption Fee: </strong> $450 + tax. This includes neuter/spay, current vaccinations as age appropriate, heartworm/tick testing if appropriate, deworming, microchip, and current preventatives</p>

This sweet girl is coming from Alabama where she and her sister were found as strays but no owners ever came forward. Her sister as adopted locally and now it is her turn for her forever home. She is an amazing dog and beautiful to boot. As a young girl, she is still learning all the things about making a great forever dog. She has a basic start to potty training but expect to start from basics in a new home. She is good in her kennel especially if she has a toy to chew on. She is amazing with both dogs and did well with the shelter cats. She is going to make an adopter very happy, as she is just so easy and wants to please. She arrives to Minnesota on 10/9 but we are accepting applications for adopters who are interested in taking her home that day. All adoptions have a two week trial period to ensure the best fit for both dog and human(s). We also do require that she be signed up for a basic training class prior to adoption.

    <strong>Description: </strong> Hitch is an approximately 18 month old blue heeler that was owner surrendered when they didn’t want him anymore. He is not your typical heeler. While he does need exercise, he is not crazy and doesn’t want a job of any kind other than being your pet and best buddy. He is great with other dogs (check out instagram) and he doesn’t seem to mind kitties, though if one ran he might fancy a chase. He would be a great walking or running buddy who settles down nicely to chill in the house while you are working. Due to his breed mix if there are kids in the home we suggest older kids. All dogs under two years old are required to be enrolled in a basic obedience training course prior to adoption.

    <strong>Description: </strong> Eric is a fun loving puppy who is doing really well at learning all his house manners! At about 12 weeks old he is very smart and has already learned many of the routines in his new foster home. He loves to cuddle his people, play with toys, play with his brother Bill who is fostered in the same home and explore! Many pups have a slight set back in potty training in a new environment but not Eric, he is doing really well with his potty training as long as there is consistency. He crates when he is not directly supervised and overnight and is quiet and learning the crate is a good place. He is looking for his forever home to keep up his good boy skills and continue teaching him all the ways of being an excellent canine companion. Both he and his brother Bill are in Minnesota and with an approved application are available for meeting and adoption. We do require that all dogs under the age of 2 years old be enrolled in a basic obedience training course prior to taking him home.

    <strong>Description: </strong> Callie is coming to us due to an unfortunate situation with her owner who has passed away due to COVID. She is said to be a beagle mix and about 7-8 years old. She has lived in a home with many other dogs, so she is dog friendly, but has not been around cats so we cannot say for sure if she is feline friendly. She is also good with people- small and large alike. If you are looking for a pup that is laid back but still has some energy for walks or basking in the sun, Callie is your girl. She would fit nicely in most homes. She arrives on 9/19 and is hoping for an adopter to pick her up that day. All adoptions have a two week trial period to make sure it is the best fit possible for dog and family. We know she is going to make someone an amazing dog for her golden years!

    <strong>Description: </strong> Sweet Pea is social, loving "mini Lab" which means we don't really know what she is but she will look like a forever Lab puppy since she is close to fully grown at about 25-30 lbs. Found on the side of the road, Sweet Pea instantly wiggled up to the first person who stopped to help her and smothered them in kisses and happy puppy love. She is excellent with other dogs, fine with the cats, and thinks everyone is her best friend. Housetraining is going well and she crates well for the workday. She is about 8-10 months old.

    <strong>Gender: </strong>Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Medium/Large (50lbs) <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Much like the little rascals dog, Oreo has a similar cute eye patch to go with her wonderful personality. Her nickname Floofbooty comes from the fact that the hair on her butt is always standing up- there is nothing medically wrong, it just stands up- it is super cute! This girl is full of fun and spunk and ready to make a family dog. Her fosters tell us she plays hard, naps hard and loves her foster siblings (of the canine variety). She was fine with the cats in shelter but she hasn’t been in a home with them. She loves to chew on toys and thinks the best ones are the ones that make crinkle noises. Her fosters are working with her on what is appropriate in house vs not- ie she may or may not have tried to put her paws on the counter a few times, now she just smells the air to “see” what might be on the counter. As a smart and clever girl, her forever home will need to continue to reinforce these boundaries. She also needs a home that is willing to exercise her to keep her mind and body tired. She is a bit leery of the plastic kennels but does well in the wire ones when nobody is home. She is doing well with potty training. She is heartworm positive and will be fully treated 9/26. She is here in Minnesota and ready to go to her forever home. Once you have an approved application you can meet her in person to see if she is the right fit. Adoptions do require signing up for a basic obedience training course prior to taking her home.

    <strong>Description: </strong> Meet your next sweet, squishy faced cuddle buddy. This squishable love was found as a stray in AL with not a penny to her name and no owners to reclaim her. She made her way into the hearts of the staff, so the rescue coordinator took her home to foster. She has been a wonderful girl in her foster. She gets along with the resident dog and cat well. She is housetrained and has been kenneled when her humans are not home and done well but the foster says she probably doesn’t need it long term. She’s going to make someone a lovely pup. She is 60lbs and about 18 months old. All dogs under 2 years of age are required to be enrolled in a training class prior to adoption (we require proof of signing up).

    <strong>Description: </strong> Suki is a young Lab mix pup who found herself an unwanted litter in a rural shelter. She is sweet little girl and gets along with other pets. She loves people and is happy to snuggle up in someone’s arms after a good play session. She is a very young pup still so her adopters should plan for all the puppy things—housetraining, cratetraining, socialization, and basic manners. Due to puppy teeth being razor sharp and being too young to know what is/isn't okay to chew/mouth, we are prioritizing adoptive homes without very young children to ensure positive experiences for all! One sharp toothed playful mouthing can be a very scary thing for young kids. We require all dogs under 2 years old to be enrolled in a training course of the adopters choosing prior to adoption.

    <strong>Size: </strong> Large (when fully grown) <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Mash Tater is a cute floof ball of a shepherd mix. He is as sweet as he is cute! He gets along with other pets and adores people. He is a very young pup still so his adopters should plan for all the puppy things—housetraining, cratetraining, socialization, and basic manners. Due to puppy teeth being razor sharp and being too young to know what is/isn't okay to chew/mouth, we are prioritizing adoptive homes without very young children to ensure positive experiences for all! One sharp toothed playful mouthing can be a very scary thing for young kids. We require all dogs under 2 years old to be enrolled in a training course of the adopters choosing prior to adoption.

    <strong>Gender: </strong>Male <br />

    <strong>Description: </strong> Meet MooMoo! This poor chap found himself at animal control in MN with not a penny to his name and terrified as all get out. He is finishing out his stray hold, but nobody has come for him yet and he is not chipped. When we met him at animal control, he was shaking in the corner of his kennel but warmed up quickly when someone sat down and went slow with him. After a few minutes he approached the new person and started taking treats. He is looking for an adopter that will be patient with him. We are unsure about his house training yet as he still is in the pound. He doesn’t seem to care about the other dogs in the pound so a home with or without another dog would be fine for him.

  <p><strong>Name: </strong>Ginger<br />
  
    <strong>Breed: </strong> Chocolate Lab Mix <br />
 
    <strong>Age: </strong>Young Adult<br />  
 
    <strong>Sex: </strong>Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Large (60 lbs) <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Ginger arrives to Minnesota on 11/6 and is looking for an adopter willing to commit to taking her home on the day she arrives. All adoptions have a two week trial period to ensure the best fit for both humans and dog!

Ginger is a young adult lab mix who was found on the side of the road with her brother from another mother Rex (he is here in MN already and adoptable). An older gentleman and his wife took care of these two when the found them and made them their own when nobody stepped up to claim them. Unfortunately the owners fell sick to where they couldn’t care for the dogs as they deserved and surrendered them to us. Ginger is in a foster home in Alabama prior to making her journey north. Much like her brother, her foster has nothing but good things to say about her. She is sweet, loving, playful and just a great dog. Her foster says she hasn’t had any accidents, but they also have some puppies in the house so she is getting let out very frequently. She has played well with all the dogs in the house so she is dog friendly and didn’t seem to bother outdoor cats but has never lived with a kitty inside. As a young lab mix she has some energy but also loves her people to cuddle and love on her. She is a truly stunning dog and has the most beautiful amber colored eyes. She arrives 11/6 and would love an adoptive home to land in!
