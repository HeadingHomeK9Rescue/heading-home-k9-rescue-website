  <p><strong>Welcome to Heading Home K9 Rescue!</strong></p>
  <p>Did you see a dog that caught your eye? Ready to start the  adoption process? Happy to help! Feel free to email the dog's listed contact with any questions you have...the dogs live in our homes with us so we know them very well.</p>
  <p> Please fill out the preadopt application (<a href="https://form.jotform.com/203104540557144" target="_blank">Heading Home K9 Rescue Preadopt Application</a>) which is the first step to meeting/adopting a dog from HHK9. We read through the application,  check references, and once approved (we aim for 2-3 days to approve or  deny depending on how quickly references reply), we set up a visit with you and the foster home or direct you to an  adoption event to meet the dog(s). Fosters are more than happy to  answer questions that arise. We all want a good match the first time, and a  successful experience for the adopter and the dog. <br /><br />
    After meeting, you can choose to adopt if it seems like a good match. You will be required to complete the adoption contract and pay their adoption fee online. There is a 7 day trial on all adoptions to ensure there is time for the dog adjust and  the fit between the dog and your home is right. If the adoption does not work out in that 7 day period, your adoption fee is refunded. We encourage adopters to give it a MINIMUM of 5 days. Returning a dog before  that period means it never had a chance to settle in and show you what the true  personality is like. Moving dogs between homes is stressful and not in the  dog's best interests. We are here to support you after adoption also, answering  questions and helping make the process as positive as we can. We highly recommend you read the tips in this packet (<a href="AdoptionFAQ.pdf" target=_blank>Adoption FAQ</a>) before bringing your new dog home...it will help greatly ease the transition and make it a positive experience for everyone! </p>
<p> Our adoption fees are non-negotiable and average about $500 for adults and $550 for puppies which includes their vet work-spay/neuter, vaccinations, heartworm testing (if old enough),microchip, deworming, and current preventatives. Often the vet costs far exceed the adoption fee, especially on our special needs dogs. We rely on adoption fees to be able to continue to rescue more dogs in need.</p>

  <p><strong>Name: </strong> Astro<br />

    <strong>Breed: </strong> Lab/ Shepherd Mix  <br />
 
    <strong>Age: </strong> Young Adult <br />  
 
    <strong>Sex: </strong> Male <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Large<br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> This handsome, leggy boy is Astro. Astro started his life on the side of a busy highway in Alabama narrowly avoiding cars and when someone stopped he was thrilled to jump to safety in their car! He is an absolutely fabulous pooch and his foster has done so much training with him. He walks wonderfully on the leash with a gentle leader, knows basic commands (sit, down, stay, crawl), and is housetrained and crates well. He is excellent with dogs and lives with them. He loves to play! He was previously fostered with kids and did fabulously too. Astro lived with cats in his Alabama foster home and he was curious and playful but both his foster and the cats would correct him for thinking the cats wanted to play and he learned to leave them alone. If he is placed with cats he would be best with dog-savvy cats and someone willing to correct his behavior off the bat and remind him that cats are not playmates. He loved water and the kiddie pools in the southern warm weather and we're sure he'll be thrilled about the MN snow too. He is a great blend of energy and playful puppy but with a lot of sense and the ability to relax as well. He is about 70 lbs and 10 months old so still growing and expected to be about 85-90 lbs once he fills out. He's in a lanky, all legs stage currently! If you are looking for an outstanding young pooch who is ready to join in any adventure and bring so much love to your life, Astro would love to meet you! 

<p><strong>Requirements: </strong> No special requirements

	
<p><strong>Adoption Fee: </strong> $550 + tax. This includes neuter/spay, current vaccinations as age appropriate, heartworm/tick testing in dogs over 8 months of age, deworming, microchip and current Heartgard and Nexgard preventatives.</p>

  <p><strong>Name: </strong> Ballet<br />

    <strong>Breed: </strong> Border Collie  <br />
 
    <strong>Age: </strong> Puppy <br />  
 
    <strong>Sex: </strong> Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Medium <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Ballet is a gorgeous Border Collie puppy who was brought into the shelter after she was found wandering after puppy curfew. No one came for her so she is now looking for a home who will love her, train her, and put that smartypants border collie brain to work. Ballet is smart as a whip and learns so fast. She absolutely thrives on being given something to do to. Puzzle toys, flirt pole, training—yes please! Ballet is typical puppy so housetraining is a work in progress but she keeps her crate clean for the workday and overnight. She is fantastic with other dogs but will herd them playfully which doesn’t always go over well with some dogs especially the little ones. She has not been around cats but would need a proper introduction to them and reminders that they aren’t for play. Ballet is of the mindset that everything is for play! Due to her breed she would be best with older kids or a herding breed experienced home who understands the tendencies to heel nip and chase kiddos to tell them where to go. If you are looking for a super fun dog who wants to join in on adventures, learn anything you want to teach, and keep you active and on your toes, Ballet wants to meet you!

Beetlejuice is a young German Shepherd/ Husky mix (best guess) who ended up in doggy jail after being found running as a stray and no one coming to claim him. He is excellent with other dogs and loves people. He is a BIG boy and needs some manners about not jumping up and being overzealous with his love so is best suited for a home with older kids and someone willing to put in some training to teach him good manners. Beetle loves to go for walks, loves to play fetch, and is happiest going on any adventure his human wants to take him on. He is housetrained, crates well for the workday, and knows basic commands.If you are an active home looking for a smart, energetic buddy, check out this boy!

    <strong>Description:</strong> Sweet Calista is a conehead right now due to coming into the shelter with a scratched cornea. Despite what must have been very irritating and painful  We don’t know how she scratched her eye but with medications it is healing well and becoming less squinty every day. It is not expected that she will have any long term complications from it. Calista loves other dogs and loves all people. She is super athletic and the typical high energy bully breed. She would love a home that wants an adventure dog to go for hikes/runs/walks, lots of playtime, or even sports (she would excel at agility or flyball). Calista is so much fun and has so much love to give. She absolutely melts into you for snuggles and would sit with you for hours if you just keep scritching her ears.

  <p><strong>Name: </strong> Caramel<br />

    <strong>Breed: </strong> Pit Bull <br />
 
    <strong>Age: </strong> Puppy<br />  
 
    <strong>Sex: </strong> Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong>~30 lbs (still growing) <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong>  Caramel the pittie puppy is a silly, loves everyone, happy to be included in everything pittie puppy! She is best friends with everyone-dog and human- she meets immediately. Caramel plays hard, loves hard, and then crashes hard for snuggles. She is fostered with other dogs and loves to play with them, though she’s a bit much for the really little dogs with her play style. Caramel is a social butterfly, the kind of pooch you can take to the cabin, breweries, kids sporting events, etc and she’ll make friends easily with everyone there. She is a puppy so housetraining is a work in progress but she is doing well. She is cratetrained and used to being crated for the workday. She does need a home without shared walls since she does bark in the kennel. Caramel is smart and learns super fast so teaching her manners and what she needs to learn to be the best dog she can be is extra fun! She would be the star of an obedience class. Caramel is about 6 months old, 30 lbs right now and expected to be a medium sized girl as an adult.

<p><strong>Adoption Fee: </strong> $550 + tax. This includes neuter/spay, current vaccinations as age appropriate, heartworm/tick testing in dogs over 8 months of age, deworming, microchip and current Heartgard and Nexgard preventatives.</p>

    <strong>Sex: </strong> Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong>~50 lbs <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Cinna is a medium sized adult mixed up mutt found tied up alone with a tag that identified her however the shelter was unable to make contact with any potential owner. How she ended up there and then not reclaimed at the shelter we don’t know but what we do know is that she was sure loved and cared for prior (note: we will not allow any negativity towards her previous owners. We do not know their circumstances or how she ended up where she was). Cinna is very playful and good with other dogs and loves people. She is a bit of a velcro dog and wants to be where her people are. She’ll contentedly lay at your feet while you work, hang out in the yard while you do yard work, and politely follow you around the house. Cinna loves to go for walks and is learning to walk nicely on the leash. She is housetrained, does not enjoy being crated and would prefer the freedom to roam around the home. She is about 45 lbs, 1-2 years old.

    <strong>Size: </strong>~50 lbs<br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong>Dolphin is an adorable husky type mix puppy who loves other dogs, loves to play, loves to sing the songs of her people, and loves to be held and loved on. She was an absolute favorite in the shelter and we can see why. Everyone falls in love with her! Dolphin is excellent with other dogs and would love a playmate. Dolphin is working on her housetraining and is used to being crated for the workday but does need a big push to get her in there. She needs a home without shared walls since she earned her name by her high pitched squeal she makes when she is crated or excited. Its adorable if you like husky noises but if you don’t its significantly less so.

    <strong>Age: </strong>Young Adult<br />  
 
    <strong>Sex: </strong> Female <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Large<br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Fendi is a uniquely colored bi colored eye girl who isn't just a pretty face. Nope, this sweetheart also has a great personality and some training under her belt! She is housetrained (though with any dog expect accidents as she transitions), crates well, and minds her manners in the house. She adores people of all ages though the little ones might get bumped over from her playful nature. She has the energy you would expect from a husky and a pittie so needs daily outlets for her energy—walks/runs, playtime, training, etc. Fendi was well known in a local impound for her frequent visits. We aren't sure if she is an escape artist or if her frequent trips out of her house were due to n o fault of her own but just in case she will need a securely fenced yard or an owner committed to leashing her (not tie-out) when outside in an unfenced area. She is good with other large breed playful dogs but is a bit too pushy in play and too much for bossy dogs or for smaller dogs. She cannot go to a home with cats or small animals. Fendi is super smart and loves to learn things. She knows how to sit, shake, and lay down. Her leash manners could use a bit of work but even with just a few training sessions she is picking up loose leash walking like an absolute champ. If you are looking for a smart, active, social dog who is ready to go on any adventure with you, Fendi wants to be your pooch!

    <strong>Description: </strong> Flip Flop is a 4-5 month old Floopy Mammoth Shepherd. You’ve never heard of that? It’s a very rare breed that we for sure didn’t make up because we really just don’t know what he is. He’s built like a tank with floopy sort-of stand up ears and going to be a big boy since he’s already pushing 45 lbs. He loves other dogs and wants to play with everyone, tried to chase the cat but when it turned around at him he did back off though probably best with cats who are dog-savvy and willing to stand up for themselves. He is working on his housetraining, crates well for the workday and overnight, and is learning all the important puppy things. He is expected to be a large or extra large dog as an adult. He is a typical puppy so a forever home should prepare for all the puppy fun, socialization, training, and everything takes to make a puppy into the best dog they can be. We highly recommend training classes to set everyone up for success.

    <strong>Sex: </strong> Male <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong>~75 lbs <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong>  Gibby was found emaciated in a tiny crate covered in his own waste by a maintenance worker who went into an apartment to check on a repair. He came to a local shelter in terrible shape, covered in urine burns, and weighing 45 lbs-nearly 30 lbs underweight. Gibby had zero training, zero manners, and quite honestly zero chance of making it out alive. He was an 8 week old puppy in a year old dog’s body. A tiny puppy jumping up on people doesn’t take them clear to the ground and puppy mouthing someone in play doesn’t leave bruises and tooth marks. From a full grown large breed dog, it does. Gibby didn’t have a mean bone in his body. Scheduled for euthanasia the very next day, our director saw something in him. She saw the potential in him and took a chance. Gibby spent 10 weeks in an extensive board and train. He graduated a whole new dog! He no longer mouths in play and he no longer hits you like a football linebacker when he’s excited. He knows how to mind his manners, he knows basic commands, and he is relaxed, happy, and confident. Gibby cannot be placed in a home with cats or small animals. He loves to play with other large breed dogs. His one issue being worked on in regards to other dogs is that he resource guards high value items and food items. This is easily mitigated with feeding him in his crate and having him in his crate or in a down-stay away from the dinner table when humans are eating. He has never shown any resource guarding with people from even the highest value items. Gibby is housetrained on a schedule and crates well. He gets a bit nervous in the crate for longer periods of time so someone home more often than not or able to let him out midday to break up the workday would be ideal. He is getting more and more comfortable in there with continued training as well. He is so smart, so responsive, and absolutely one of the most fun dogs you’d ever want to meet. We are so glad our director took a risk on this guy…he was worth it 1000x over. 

<p><strong>Requirements: </strong> No cats. Adult-only home willing to keep up training.

    <strong>Description: </strong>  Is this a plush toy? Nope, it’s Kaia! She is a stunning husky who found herself in dog prison after taking herself on an adventure. We were shocked when no owner came forward for her. Kaia is a friendly girl and gets along great with other dogs. No cats for her though! She is the typical husky escape artist so needs a home with a taller fence (she jumped out of her 5’ kennel run at the shelter) or a home committed to leash walks. Kaia absolutely loves to go for walks and will sing her happy woo-woos when you grab her leash. She is a vocal girl so needs a home without shared walls since not everyone wants to hear her sing the songs of her people…how strange! Kaia is as pretty inside as she is outside and a husky loving home is going to be so thrilled they chose her! Kaia is about 50 lbs, 6 years old.

She is  housetrained on a schedule, crates for the workday but hates the crate and  needs either a sturdy crate or a dog-proofed area to stay. She loves her walks  and loves to toss toys around and chew on bones. Her mischievous streak you may  ask? This girl is a counter surfer! She is so talented in it she has been known  to take dishes out of the sink so delicately in fact that she doesn&rsquo;t even  break them. So she needs someone to keep working on this and keeping things put  away so she doesn&rsquo;t have the opportunity to be inadvertently rewarded for it.  Mazzie is excellent with dogs, loves all people, but does like to chase cats  too much for her to be safe placed with them. She is a husky and does like to  sing the song of her people when she has something to say so needs a home  without a shared walls. She would be best with a fenced yard or someone  committed to leashed walks (not tie-out) due to her willingness to be a typical  husky and go exploring on her own.

    <strong>Description: </strong> Meesha is a 3 year old Pittie full of wiggles and love. She is a big-eared, big-hearted absolute doll of a dog. She is housetrained, crates well but doesn’t need it, great house manners, and loves everyone. She knows how to sit, shake, and even walks well on the leash! Meesha is a ready-made good girl who wants a family to join and love on. She is medium energy, loves her walks but is content to snooze as well. She seems confused by toys or she may just rather the butt scritches she gets from the people more than the toys! People are her love more than absolutely anything else.

    <strong>Age: </strong> Puppy <br />  
 
    <strong>Sex: </strong> Male <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong>Large when fully grown<br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong>  Mouse is a very timid GSD (mix?) puppy who hasn’t had many life experiences and it’s left him unsure of everything—new people, new noises, wearing a collar/leash, etc. He is a shy guy that needs a home who will help bring his confidence out and give him the happy puppyhood he deserved to have. Mouse loves other dogs, especially those that will play with him, and really relies on having a confident dog around to follow to help show him new things are ok. Once he knows you, he is a loyal friend who wants to follow you everywhere, sit in your lap, and bring you all his toys for you to enjoy. Mouse is food motivated which helps his training immensely. The potential for him is there and a confident dog is right under the surface. In a patient, experienced home who will take the time and put in the work he will absolutely flourish!

    <strong>Description: </strong>Big head, stocky legs, minimal thoughts, lots of love—that’s our Poggle! He is a sweet, handsome guy with so much love to give to whoever adopts him. He fancies himself a lap dog and we don’t have the heart to tell him he isn’t. He is fabulous with all people, good with other dogs, and ignores the cats. Poggle is housetrained and crates well though much prefers to be left loose in the house and he has so far been good with that at his foster home. Poggle loves his walks and tossing around toys but is equally content to take a nice snooze. His leash manners leave a lot to be desired but hey, no one is perfect. He is learning that pulling ahead like a freight train gets him nowhere and if he doesn’t he gets some love and a little treat which are 2 things he loves more than anything! While he leads with his heart, there’s a brain in that head and a strong desire to please (and get treats).

    <strong>Description: </strong> Rookie is a 8-9 month old, 30 lb Pocket Wiggle Loaf. You haven’t heard of that breed? They are very rare and definitely not one we just made up because we have no idea what Rookie is ;). He looks like a German Shepherd type mix but so much smaller for his age. In fact we thought he was a much younger puppy when he first came into the shelter. Rookie is shyer initially with new experiences but give him a few treats and he is all puppy and all about the snuggles, the fun, and finding the happiness in everything. That water bottle in the street that we see as litter…why that is his new chompy toss around toy! The barking dog bouncing off the walls in her run at the shelter that scares other dogs….his future best friend! Rookie is fabulous with dogs, loves people, and was curious about the cats but didn’t bother them.

    <strong>Description: </strong> Rusty is a middle-aged Lab mix who does not understand how he landed himself in the shelter. Quite frankly, we don’t either. This guy is wonderful! At about 7 years old he is well past the crazy puppy stages and settled into being a well-mannered, housetrained, cratetrained but doesn’t need it and prefers to be loose in the house, easy to live with type guy. He absolutely loves to go for walks and when you pull his leash out he turns right back into a puppy with excitement. He walks well on the leash after an initial bout of excitement pulling and knows basic commands. Rusty has lived with dogs and cats and does well with all. He is loving and friendly to all people. We can’t say enough good things about Rusty. He isn’t flashy in looks, he isn’t a cute little puppy anymore, but he’s got years and years of experience being a good boy to share with a forever home.

    <strong>Sex: </strong> Male <br />

    <strong>Size: </strong> Large <br />

    		
    <strong>Description: </strong> Did you ever think you’d see a manatee up for adoption? Neither did we but yet here Sea Cow is. He barks like a dog but looks like a manatee so what species he actually is you can decide for yourself. Good news though, he’s not aquatic so ready to move into your home and remain on land! Sea Cow is a big, round, stocky Bully breed with a giant heart, giant head, and a giant personality. He is a goofy bulldozer of a dog without a lick of understanding that he’s a big boy and will plant his jumbo booty right in your lap as if he’s tiny. We just don’t have the heart to tell him he isn’t. Sea Cow loves other dogs and thinks they all want to be immediate playmates with him. He has never met anyone, dog or human, that isn’t immediately his best friend. Cats are confusing to him. The shelter cat swatted him hard when he stuck his face all up in her business and he just stood there completely baffled about the stabby hand animal. He doesn’t appear to have much prey drive but he also isn’t particularly aware that cats might not want him all up in their business with no spatial awareness. Sea Cow is housetrained once he knows the routine, crates well, and does well in the house. He loves to chomp on nylabones while chilling by his people, struts his stuff on walks, and does his best pot belly pig impression flopped on his side napping in the sun. If you ever wanted to own a manatee but the habitat requirements were always preventing it, Sea Cow is the solution to all your problems (well, maybe just that one).

    <strong>Sex: </strong> Female <br />

    <strong>Description: </strong>  Stuffy is a husky/Pomeranian who is everything a Pomsky should be—good, bad, and everything in between. If you like a dog with lots of personality, mischief, and sass then you will love Stuffy. If you want a quiet, mellow dog who always minds and never talks back then Stuffy is not for you. She is heavy on the husky in looks but in a smaller, petite package. Stuffy adores other dogs and loves to play with them. She is a bit pushy in play and overwhelming to calm dogs because she doesn’t take no for an answer—because who wouldn’t want to play with her? For a playful dog she is a best friend since she can go on and on running and wrestling. Stuffy adores people and is tolerant of everything. She frequently gets picked up to get put in her kennel and doesn’t even mind “air jail”. Will she tell you her opinions of being locked up…absolutely. Stuffy is not for apartments or shared walls unless your neighbors too would like to hear her opinions shouted. She is housetrained, crates for the workday, and does mind her manners in the house as best as her little mischievous self can—she doesn’t know how the trash can got tipped over or why the barbie doesn’t have feet anymore but definitely probably was not her ;). Stuffy will bring so much love, happy chaos, and fun to any house lucky enough to choose her.

    <strong>Description: </strong>A pretty face and legs up to here, Tarot has all the makings of a model. He doesn't have a big head about it though! This humble guy came into a local impound after suffering a horrific injury at the hands of someone who had just purchased him in the days prior. He has spent the last few months healing and his wound is almost fully healed and he is nearly ready to find his forever home! He is an absolute love. He had endless patience with all the bandage changes, the cone wearing, and the vet visits. He didn't enjoy the short term restricted activity though! Thankfully it was only a week and he was cleared to be his playful self. This guy is the energy level you'd expect from his breeds and needs an active home who can tire him out mentally and physically. He is smart, he loves to work out puzzle and food toys, and is an excellent walking/jogging partner. He is quite the water dog as well! He is excellent with dogs and likes to play with them though equally loves his humans and would be happy in a home with or without another dog. He is housetrained and crates well but prefers to be in a dog-proofed area rather than a crate when alone. He is gated in the hallway with a bone and dog bed at his foster home and he does much better with that than in the crate
